TI  - Diet approach before and after bariatric surgery.
PG  - 297-306
LID - 10.1007/s11154-020-09571-8 [doi]
AB  - Bariatric surgery (BS) is today the most effective therapy for inducing long-term 
      weight loss and for reducing comorbidity burden and mortality in patients with 
      severe obesity. On the other hand, BS may be associated to new clinical problems, 
      complications and side effects, in particular in the nutritional domain. 
      Therefore, the nutritional management of the bariatric patients requires specific 
      nutritional skills. In this paper, a brief overview of the nutritional management 
      of the bariatric patients will be provided from pre-operative to post-operative 
      phase. Patients with severe obesity often display micronutrient deficiencies when 
      compared to normal weight controls. Therefore, nutritional status should be 
      checked in every patient and correction of deficiencies attempted before surgery. 
      At present, evidences from randomized and retrospective studies do not support 
      the hypothesis that pre-operative weight loss could improve weight loss after BS 
      surgery, and the insurance-mandated policy of a preoperative weight loss as a 
      pre-requisite for admission to surgery is not supported by medical evidence. On 
      the contrary, some studies suggest that a modest weight loss of 5-10% in the 
      immediate preoperative period could facilitate surgery and reduce the risk of 
      complications. Very low calories diet (VLCD) and very low calories ketogenic 
      diets (VLCKD) are the most frequently used methods for the induction of a 
      pre-operative weight loss today. After surgery, nutritional counselling is 
      recommended in order to facilitate the adaptation of the eating habits to the new 
      gastro-intestinal physiology. Nutritional deficits may arise according to the 
      type of bariatric procedure and they should be prevented, diagnosed and 
      eventually treated. Finally, specific nutritional problems, like dumping syndrome 
      and reactive hypoglycaemia, can occur and should be managed largely by 
      nutritional manipulation. In conclusion, the nutritional management of the 
      bariatric patients requires specific nutritional skills and the intervention of 
      experienced nutritionists and dieticians.

TI  - Ketogenic Diet as Medical Prescription in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 
      (PCOS).
PG  - 56-64
LID - 10.1007/s13668-023-00456-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine 
      dysfunction associated with a myriad of metabolic disorders and high rate of 
      infertility. In order to aid its management, several lifestyle/dietary 
      interventions have been evaluated. Very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is 
      rapidly showing promising benefits not only in obesity but also in the treatment 
      of other metabolic diseases. The main objective of this review is to assess the 
      scientific evidence in support of this dietary pattern as an effective measure 
      for treating PCOS and the metabolic disorders associated with it. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Preliminary data suggested significant improvements in body weight and 
      composition, metabolic profile (glucose, serum insulin, triglycerides, total and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and insulin resistance following VLCKD. 
      However, the evidence is still scarce and needs to be more substantiated. Weight 
      reduction in women with PCOS has been shown to improve metabolic derangements and 
      body composition, but there is no consensus on the ideal dietary pattern or 
      macronutrient composition. There is some evidence supporting the possible role of 
      the Mediterranean diet in improving infertility (along with other well-known 
      metabolic benefits) in women with PCOS. Of note, VLCKD might be considered a 
      potential intervention for the short-term treatment of PCOS, but it must be 
      prescribed and carefully guided by professionals.

TI  - Ketogenic Diet: A Nutritional Therapeutic Tool for Lipedema?
PG  - 529-543
LID - 10.1007/s13679-023-00536-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to provide an overview of the current 
      evidence on the efficacy, also considering the anti-inflammatory properties and 
      safety of very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) as a potential treatment for 
      lipedema, particularly in the context of obesity. RECENT FINDINGS: Lipedema is a 
      chronic disease characterized by abnormal and painful fat buildup on the legs 
      and/or arms. It is often misdiagnosed as obesity or lymphedema. However, although 
      lipedema and obesity can coexist, unlike obesity, lipedema usually affects the 
      legs and thighs without affecting the feet or hands, and the abnormal deposition 
      of adipose tissue in lipedema is painful. The current lifestyle interventions are 
      often unsuccessful in the management of lipedema. There is no consensus on the 
      most effective nutritional approach for managing lipedema. Recent studies have 
      suggested that VLCKD may be an effective treatment for lipedema, demonstrating 
      that it is also superior to other nutritional approaches such as Mediterranean 
      diet or intermittent fasting. Lipedema is a chronic and debilitating disease 
      characterized by abnormal and painful accumulation of adipose tissue in the legs. 
      VLCKD has been shown to be an effective treatment for lipedema, especially in the 
      context of obesity, due to its anti-inflammatory properties. However, further 
      research is needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of VLCKD as a 
      treatment for lipedema.

TI  - European Guidelines for Obesity Management in Adults with a Very Low-Calorie 
      Ketogenic Diet: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 222-245
LID - 10.1159/000515381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has been recently 
      proposed as an appealing nutritional strategy for obesity management. The VLCKD 
      is characterized by a low carbohydrate content (<50 g/day), 1-1.5 g of protein/kg 
      of ideal body weight, 15-30 g of fat/day, and a daily intake of about 500-800 
      calories. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current document is to suggest a common 
      protocol for VLCKD and to summarize the existing literature on its efficacy in 
      weight management and weight-related comorbidities, as well as the possible side 
      effects. METHODS: This document has been prepared in adherence with Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 
      Literature searches, study selection, methodology development, and quality 
      appraisal were performed independently by 2 authors and the data were collated by 
      means of a meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Of the 645 articles 
      retrieved, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed, revealing 4 
      main findings. First, the VLCKD was shown to result in a significant weight loss 
      in the short, intermediate, and long terms and improvement in body composition 
      parameters as well as glycemic and lipid profiles. Second, when compared with 
      other weight loss interventions of the same duration, the VLCKD showed a major 
      effect on reduction of body weight, fat mass, waist circumference, total 
      cholesterol and triglyceridemia as well as improved insulin resistance. Third, 
      although the VLCKD also resulted in a significant reduction of glycemia, HbA1c, 
      and LDL cholesterol, these changes were similar to those obtained with other 
      weight loss interventions. Finally, the VLCKD can be considered a safe 
      nutritional approach under a health professional's supervision since the most 
      common side effects are usually clinically mild and easily to manage and recovery 
      is often spontaneous. CONCLUSIONS: The VLCKD can be recommended as an effective 
      dietary treatment for individuals with obesity after considering potential 
      contra-indications and keeping in mind that any dietary treatment has to be 
      personalized. Prospero Registry: The assessment of the efficacy of VLCKD on body 
      weight, body composition, glycemic and lipid parameters in overweight and obese 
      subjects: a meta-analysis (CRD42020205189).

AB  - The role of very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in the long-term 
      management of obesity is not well established. The present meta-analysis aimed to 
      investigate whether individuals assigned to a VLCKD (i.e. a diet with no more 
      than 50 g carbohydrates/d) achieve better long-term body weight and 
      cardiovascular risk factor management when compared with individuals assigned to 
      a conventional low-fat diet (LFD; i.e. a restricted-energy diet with less than 
      30% of energy from fat). Through August 2012, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, 
      ScienceDirect,Scopus, LILACS, SciELO, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature 
      databases were searched, using no date or language restrictions, for randomised 
      controlled trials that assigned adults to a VLCKD or a LFD, with 12 months or 
      more of follow-up. The primary outcome was bodyweight. The secondary outcomes 
      were TAG, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure,glucose, insulin, HbA1c and C-reactive protein levels. A 
      total of thirteen studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the overall 
      analysis,five outcomes revealed significant results. Individuals assigned to a 
      VLCKD showed decreased body weight (weighted mean difference -0·91 (95% CI -1·65, 
      -0·17) kg, 1415 patients), TAG (weighted mean difference -0·18 (95% CI -0·27, 
      -0·08) mmol/l, 1258 patients)and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean 
      difference -1·43 (95% CI -2·49, -0·37) mmHg, 1298 patients) while increased 
      HDL-C(weighted mean difference 0·09 (95% CI 0·06, 0·12) mmol/l, 1257 patients) 
      and LDL-C (weighted mean difference 0·12 (95% CI 0·04,0·2) mmol/l, 1255 
      patients). Individuals assigned to a VLCKD achieve a greater weight loss than 
      those assigned to a LFD in the longterm; hence, a VLCKD may be an alternative 
      tool against obesity.

AB  - The epidemic of obesity is growing steadily across the whole world. Obesity is 
      not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases 
      such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
      obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a 
      strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional 
      strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. 
      Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a 
      successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight 
      loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases 
      the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to 
      preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in 
      glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of 
      data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be 
      used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity. In particular, we 
      will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for 
      weight loss and management of side effects.

TI  - Mediterranean Diet versus Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet: Effects of Reaching 5% 
      Body Weight Loss on Body Composition in Subjects with Overweight and with 
      Obesity-A Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph192013040 [doi]

AB  - The best nutritional strategy to fight the rise in obesity remains a debated 
      issue. The Mediterranean diet (MD) and the Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD) are effective at helping people lose body weight (BW) and fat mass (FM) 
      while preserving fat-free mass (FFM). This study aimed to evaluate the time these 
      two diets took to reach a loss of 5% of the initial BW and how body composition 
      was affected. We randomized 268 subjects with obesity or overweight in two arms, 
      MD and VLCKD, for a maximum of 3 months or until they reached 5% BW loss. This 
      result was achieved after one month of VLCKD and 3 months of MD. Both diets were 
      effective in terms of BW (p < 0.0001) and FM loss (p < 0.0001), but the MD 
      reached a higher reduction in both waist circumference (p = 0.0010) and FM (p = 
      0.0006) and a greater increase in total body water (p = 0.0017) and FFM (p = 
      0.0373) than VLCKD. The population was also stratified according to gender, age, 
      and BMI. These two nutritional protocols are both effective in improving 
      anthropometrical parameters and body composition, but they take different time 
      spans to reach the goal. Therefore, professionals should evaluate which is the 
      most suitable according to each patient's health status.

AB  - Background: Currently the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
      is based on weight loss through lifestyle changes, such as exercise combined with 
      calorie-restricted dieting. Objectives: To assess the effects of a commercially 
      available weight loss program based on a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) 
      on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat content compared to a standard 
      low-calorie (LC) diet. As a secondary aim, we evaluated the effect on liver 
      stiffness measurements. Methods: Open, randomized controlled, prospective pilot 
      study. Patients were randomized and treated either with an LC or a VLCKD and 
      received orientation and encouragement to physical activity equally for both 
      groups. VAT, liver fat fraction, and liver stiffness were measured at baseline 
      and after 2 months of treatment using magnetic resonance imaging. Paired t-tests 
      were used for comparison of continuous variables between visits and unpaired test 
      between groups. Categorical variables were compared using the χ(2)-test. Pearson 
      correlation was used to assess the association between VAT, anthropometric 
      measures, and hepatic fat fraction. A significance level of the results was 
      established at p < 0.05. Results: Thirty-nine patients (20 with VLCKD and 19 with 
      LC) were evaluated at baseline and 2 months of intervention. Relative weight loss 
      at 2 months was -9.59 ± 2.87% in the VLCKD group and -1.87 ± 2.4% in the LC group 
      (p < 0.001). Mean reductions in VAT were -32.0 cm(2) for VLCKD group and -12.58 
      cm(2) for LC group (p < 0.05). Reductions in liver fat fraction were 
      significantly more pronounced in the VLCKD group than in the LC group (4.77 vs. 
      0.79%; p < 0.005). Conclusion: Patients undergoing a VLCKD achieved superior 
      weight loss, with significant VAT and liver fat fraction reductions when compared 
      to the standard LC diet. The weight loss and rapid mobilization of liver fat 
      demonstrated with VLCKD could serve as an effective alternative for the treatment 
      of NAFLD. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier:

TI  - Does the Ketogenic Diet Improve the Quality of Ovarian Function in Obese Women?
LID - 10.3390/nu14194147 [doi]
LID - 4147
AB  - Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine 
      disorder in women of reproductive age, the prevalence of which ranges from 8 to 
      13%. It is characterized by metabolic, reproductive, and psychological 
      alterations. PCOS prevalence is related to body mass index (BMI). Women with BMI 
      < 25 kg/m2 have a prevalence of 4.3%, whereas women with BMI > 30 kg/m2 have a 
      prevalence of 14%. Moreover, women with PCOS have a risk of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) two-fold higher than controls, independently of BMI. Both PCOS 
      and T2DM are also consequences of lower serum sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) 
      levels, which is currently considered a biomarker of metabolic disorders, in 
      particular T2DM. Aim: To evaluate the effect of the very-low-calorie ketogenic 
      diet (VLCKD) on markers suggested to be predictive of metabolic and ovulatory 
      dysfunction. These comprehend SHBG, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and 
      progesterone levels on day 21 of the menstrual cycle in a cohort of obese 
      non-diabetic women with PCOS and regular menses. Methods: Twenty-five patients 
      (mean age 25.4 ± 3.44 years) with obesity and PCOS underwent VLCKD for 12 weeks. 
      Each of them underwent measurements of anthropometric parameters (body weight, 
      height, and waist circumference) and blood testing to evaluate serum levels of 
      SHBG, AMH, and progesterone before and after 12 weeks of VLCKD. Results: At 
      enrollment, all patients had high BMI, WC, and AMH, whereas SHBG and progesterone 
      levels were low. After VLCKD, the patients showed a significant reduction in BMI, 
      WC, and HOMA index. In particular, 76% of patients (19/25) switched from obesity 
      to overweight, and the HOMA index normalized, reaching values lower than 2.5 in 
      96% (24/25) of patients. In addition, serum AMH levels significantly decreased, 
      and progesterone and SHBG significantly increased after VLCKD. Conclusions: This 
      is the first study documenting the effects of VLCKD on ovarian reserve and luteal 
      function in women with PCOS. VLCKD could be used to improve metabolic and 
      ovulatory dysfunction in women with PCOS. Further studies are needed to 
      understand the reasons for the AMH reduction.

TI  - Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet: A Safe and Effective Tool for Weight Loss in 
      Patients With Obesity and Mild Kidney Failure.
LID - 10.3390/nu12020333 [doi]
LID - 333
AB  - Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) are an effective and increasingly used 
      tool for weight loss. Traditionally considered high protein, ketogenic diets are 
      often looked at with concern by clinicians due to the potential harm they pose to 
      kidney function. We herein evaluated the efficacy and safety of a VLCKD in 
      patients with obesity and mild kidney failure. A prospective observational 
      real-life study was conducted on ninety-two patients following a VLCKD for 
      approximately 3 months. Thirty-eight had mild kidney failure and fifty-four had 
      no renal condition and were therefore designated as control. Anthropometric 
      parameters, bioelectrical impedance and biochemistry data were collected before 
      and at the end of the dietary intervention. The average weight loss was nearly 
      20% of initial weight, with a significant reduction in fat mass. We report an 
      improvement of metabolic parameters and no clinically relevant variation 
      regarding liver and kidney function. Upon stratification based on kidney 
      function, no differences in the efficacy and safety outcomes were found. 
      Interestingly, 27.7% of patients with mild renal failure reported normalization 
      of glomerular filtrate after dietary intervention. We conclude that, when 
      conducted under the supervision of healthcare professionals, a VLCKD is an 
      effective and safe treatment for weight loss in patients with obesity, including 
      those affected by mild kidney failure.

TI  - Italian Ketogenic Mediterranean Diet in Overweight and Obese Patients with 
      Prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.3390/nu14204361 [doi]
LID - 4361
AB  - Obesity is a multifactorial disease strongly associated with insulin resistance 
      and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Correct nutrition represents a valid strategy to 
      fight these dysmetabolic pathologies responsible for numerous diseases, including 
      inflammatory and cardiovascular ones. Medical nutrition therapy, including a 
      Mediterranean diet (MD) and a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLKCD), is the 
      first-line treatment for prediabetes/diabetes and overweight/obesity. Eighty 
      patients (forty women and forty men) affected by overweight/obesity and type 2 
      diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (51 
      (ys) ± 1.75; BMI (kg/m(2)) 33.08 ± 1.93; HA1c (%): 6.8% ± 0.25) were enrolled at 
      the University Service of Diet Therapy, Diabetology and Metabolic Diseases, 
      Policlinico Riuniti Hospital of Foggia, and subjected to a very-low-calorie 
      Mediterranean diet and a very-low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet for thirty 
      days. Both diets result in a marked decrease in body weight (kg) and BMI 
      (kg/m(2)). At the same time, only the very-low-calories ketogenic Mediterranean 
      diet reduced waist and hip circumferences. Both diets helped reduce fat mass, but 
      a major loss was achieved in a very low-calorie ketogenic Mediterranean diet. 
      Among gluco-metabolic parameters, only the very-low-calorie ketogenic 
      Mediterranean diet group showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose 
      and HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. The 
      results of our study seem to show that the very-low-calorie ketogenic 
      Mediterranean diet is a good strategy to improve rapidly metabolic, 
      anthropometric, and body composition parameters in patients with prediabetes or 
      diabetes and overweight/obesity.

TI  - Very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in the management of metabolic diseases: 
      systematic review and consensus statement from the Italian Society of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight loss is a milestone in the prevention of chronic diseases 
      associated with high morbility and mortality in industrialized countries. 
      Very-low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) are increasingly used in clinical 
      practice for weight loss and management of obesity-related comorbidities. Despite 
      evidence on the clinical benefits of VLCKDs is rapidly emerging, some concern 
      still exists about their potential risks and their use in the long-term, due to 
      paucity of clinical studies. Notably, there is an important lack of guidelines on 
      this topic, and the use and implementation of VLCKDs occurs vastly in the absence 
      of clear evidence-based indications. PURPOSE: We describe here the biochemistry, 
      benefits and risks of VLCKDs, and provide recommendations on the correct use of 
      this therapeutic approach for weight loss and management of metabolic diseases at 
      different stages of life.

TI  - High Fat Diet and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in Adolescence: An Overview of 
      Nutritional Strategies.
LID - 10.3390/nu16070938 [doi]
LID - 938
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted and heterogeneous disorder, 
      linked with notable reproductive, metabolic, and psychological outcomes. During 
      adolescence, key components of PCOS treatment involve weight loss achieved 
      through lifestyle and dietary interventions, subsequently pursued by 
      pharmacological or surgical therapies. Nutritional interventions represent the 
      first-line therapeutic approach in adolescents affected by PCOS, but different 
      kinds of dietary protocols exist, so it is necessary to clarify the effectiveness 
      and benefits of the most well-known nutritional approaches. We provided a 
      comprehensive review of the current literature concerning PCOS definition, 
      pathophysiology, and treatment options, highlighting nutritional strategies, 
      particularly those related to high-fat diets. The high-fat nutritional protocols 
      proposed in the literature, such as the ketogenic diet (KD), appear to provide 
      benefits to patients with PCOS in terms of weight loss and control of metabolic 
      parameters. Among the different types of KD studies, very low-calorie ketogenic 
      diets (VLCKD), can be considered an effective dietary intervention for the 
      short-term treatment of patients with PCOS. It rapidly leads to weight loss 
      alongside improvements in body composition and metabolic profile. Even though 
      extremely advantageous, long-term adherence to the KD is a limiting factor. 
      Indeed, this dietary regimen could become unsustainable due to the important 
      restrictions required for ketosis development. Thus, a combination of high-fat 
      diets with more nutrient-rich nutritional regimens, such as the Mediterranean 
      diet, can amplify positive effects for individuals with PCOS.

TI  - Very Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet for the Treatment of Severe Obesity and 
      Associated Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The Role of Sex Differences.
LID - 10.3390/nu12092748 [doi]
LID - 2748
AB  - Very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) are an emerging nutritional 
      treatment for severe obesity and are associated with a significant improvement in 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Little is known about the effect of 
      sex differences on weight loss induced by following a VLCKD. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the effects of sex differences on weight loss and NAFLD 
      improvement in patients with severe obesity undergoing a VLCKD. Forty-two females 
      and 28 males with severe obesity underwent a 25-day VLCKD. Anthropometric 
      parameters, bioimpedentiometry, degree of liver steatosis measured by 
      ultrasonography, liver function tests, and glucose homeostasis were measured 
      before and after the VLCKD. Males experienced a significantly larger excess body 
      weight loss (EBWL) and a greater reduction in γ-glutamyl transferase (γGT) than 
      females. Dividing the female group by menopausal status, a significant difference 
      between males and pre-menopausal females was found for both EBWL and γGT. No 
      significant difference between groups was observed for improvement in the 
      Edmonton stage or in the degree of steatosis. We conclude that the efficacy of 
      following a VLCKD in severe obesity is affected by sex differences and, for 
      females, by menopausal status. Males seem to experience larger benefits than 
      females in terms of EBWL and NAFLD improvement. These differences are attenuated 
      after menopause, probably because of changes in hormonal profile and body 
      composition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine is the second world's cause of disability. Among 
      non-pharmacological treatments, nutritional intervention, particularly ketogenic 
      diet, represents one of the most promising approaches. METHODS: This a 
      prospective, single center, randomized, controlled study aimed at evaluating the 
      efficacy of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) compared to a hypocaloric 
      balanced diet (HBD) in migraine prophylaxis in patients affected by 
      high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) with a Body Mass Index 
      (BMI) > 27 kg/m(2). Fifty-seven patients were randomly assigned to a VLCKD (group 
      1) or HBD (group 2). Group 1 patients followed a VLCKD for 8 weeks, followed by a 
      low calorie diet (LCD, weeks 9-12), and a HBD (weeks 13-24), whereas group 2 
      patients followed a HBD from week 0 to 24. Anthropometric indexes, urine and 
      blood chemistry were assessed at enrollment, baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. 
      Migraine characteristics were evaluated at baseline, weeks 8, 12 and 24. Change 
      in monthly migraine days (MMDs) at weeks 5-8 compared to baseline was the primary 
      endpoint. Secondary endpoints encompassed changes in visual analogue scale (VAS), 
      Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) and Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) scores. We 
      also studied effects on circulating lymphocytes and markers of inflammation, 
      changes in plasma aldosterone and renin levels before and after VLCKD or HBD 
      treatment. RESULTS: Reduction from baseline in MMDs was greater in VLCKD compared 
      to HBD group at week 8 (p = 0.008), at week 12 (p = 0.007), when ketosis had been 
      interrupted by carbohydrates reintroduction, and at week 24 (p = 0.042), when all 
      patients were following the same dietary regimen. Quality of life scores (SF-36) 
      were improved in VLCKD group at week 8 and 12, and were also improved in HBD 
      group, but only at week 12. Weight-loss was significantly higher in VLCKD group 
      at week 8 (p = 0.002) and week 12 (p = 0.020). At the end of the study weight 
      loss was maintained in VLCKD group whereas a slight weight regain was observed in 
      HBD group. Inflammatory indexes, namely C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil to 
      lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and total white blood cell count (WBC) were significantly 
      reduced (p < 0.05) in VLCKD group at week 12. Aldosterone plasma level were 
      significantly increased in both groups at week 8, particularly in VLCKD group. 
      However, electrolytes and renin plasma levels were never altered throughout the 
      study in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: VLCKD is more effective than HBD in reducing 
      MMD in patients with HFEM and represents an effective prophylaxis in patients 
      with overweight/obesity. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:

TI  - The effect of the ketogenic diet on Acne: Could it be a therapeutic tool?
PG  - 6850-6869
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2023.2176813 [doi]
AB  - Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from 
      androgen-induced increased sebum production, altered keratinization, 
      inflammation, and bacterial colonization of the hair follicles of the face, neck, 
      chest and back by Propionibacterium acnes. Overall, inflammation and immune 
      responses are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of acne. Although early 
      colonization with Propionibacterium acnes and family history may play an 
      important role in the disease, it remains unclear exactly what triggers acne and 
      how treatment affects disease progression. The influence of diet on acne disease 
      is a growing research topic, yet few studies have examined the effects of diet on 
      the development and clinical severity of acne disease, and the results have often 
      been contradictory. Interestingly, very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has 
      been associated with both significant reductions in body weight and inflammatory 
      status through the production of ketone bodies and thus it has been expected to 
      reduce the exacerbation of clinical manifestations or even block the trigger of 
      acne disease. Given the paucity of studies regarding the implementation of VLCKD 
      in the management of acne, this review aims to provide evidence from the 
      available scientific literature to support the speculative use of VLCKD in the 
      treatment of acne.

TI  - Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet as a Safe and Valuable Tool for Long-Term 
      Glycemic Management in Patients with Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.3390/nu13030758 [doi]
LID - 758
AB  - Obesity-related type 2 diabetes represents one of the most difficult challenges 
      for the healthcare system. This retrospective study aims to determine the 
      efficacy, safety and durability of a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), 
      compared to a standard low-calorie diet (LCD) on weight-loss, glycemic 
      management, eating behavior and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      (T2DM) and obesity. Thirty patients with obesity and T2DM, aged between 35 and 75 
      years, who met the inclusion criteria and accepted to adhere to a VLCKD or a LCD 
      nutritional program, were consecutively selected from our electronic database. 
      Fifteen patients followed a structured VLCKD protocol, fifteen followed a 
      classical LCD. At the beginning of the nutritional protocol, all patients were 
      asked to stop any antidiabetic medications, with the exception of metformin. Data 
      were collected at baseline and after 3 (T1) and 12 (T2) months. At T1 and T2, BMI 
      was significantly reduced in the VLCKD group (p < 0.001), whereas it remained 
      substantially unchanged in the LCD group. HbA1c was significantly reduced in the 
      VLCKD group (p = 0.002), whereas a slight, although not significant, decrease was 
      observed in the LCD group. Quality of life and eating behavior scores were 
      improved in the VLCKD group, whereas no significant changes were reported in the 
      LCD group, both at T1 and T2. At the end of the study, in the VLCKD group 26.6% 
      of patients had stopped all antidiabetic medications, and 73.3% were taking only 
      metformin, whereas 46.6% of LCD patients had to increase antidiabetic 
      medications. The study confirms a valuable therapeutic effect of VLCKD in the 
      long-term management of obesity and T2DM and its potential contribution to 
      remission of the disease.

      Diseases of the Female Reproductive System: A Practical Guide for Nutritionists.
PG  - 231-249
LID - 10.1007/s13679-023-00516-1 [doi]
AB  - This narrative review explored the role of ketogenic diets (KDs) in improving 
      fertility outcomes, low-grade inflammation, body weight, visceral adipose tissue, 
      and its potential use in certain types of cancer, through its favorable actions 
      on mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species generation, chronic 
      inflammation, and tumor growth inhibition. RECENT FINDINGS  : Nutrition is 
      crucial to maintain the female reproductive system's health. Evidence on the 
      association between diet and female reproductive system has greatly expanded over 
      the last decade, leading to the identification of specific diet therapy, 
      particularly KDs. KDs has been proved to be an effective weight-loss tool. To 
      date, KDs is being increasingly used in the treatment of many diseases, such as 
      obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus. KDs is a dietary intervention capable of 
      ameliorating the inflammatory state and oxidative stress through several 
      mechanisms. Due to the increasing use of KDs beyond obesity, this literature 
      review will provide the latest scientific evidence of its possible use in common 
      disorders of the female endocrine-reproductive tract, and a practical guide to 
      its use in these patients.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in patients with 
      overweight and obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 5-16
LID - 10.1007/s11154-019-09514-y [doi]
AB  - Very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has been proposed as a promising option 
      to achieve a significant weight loss in a short time period. We conducted a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate its efficacy and safety in 
      patients with overweight and obesity. Four databases were searched on May 2019. 
      Studies reporting data on body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist 
      circumference, body composition, blood pressure, HbA1c, lipids, and markers of 
      liver and kidney function were selected. Discontinuation was also assessed. 
      Twelve studies were included. VLCKD was associated with weight losses of -10.0 kg 
      (I(2) = 6%) and - 15.6 kg (I(2) = 37%) in studies with a ketogenic phase up to 
      and of at least four weeks, respectively. The weight lost during the ketogenic 
      phase was stable in the subsequent follow-up up to two years (p = 0.12). Also, 
      VLCKD was associated with reductions of BMI (-5.3 kg/m(2)), waist circumference 
      (-12.6 cm), HbA1c (-0.7%), total cholesterol (-28 mg/dl), triglycerides 
      (-30 mg/dl), AST (-7 U/l), ALT (-8 U/l), GGT (-8 U/l), systolic and diastolic 
      blood pressure (-8 and - 7 mmHg, respectively). No changes in LDL cholesterol, 
      HDL cholesterol, serum creatinine, serum uric acid and serum potassium were 
      found. Serum sodium increased during VLCKD (+1.6 mEq/l). The overall prevalence 
      of patients discontinuing VLCKD was 7.5% and this was similar to patients 
      undergoing a low calorie diet (p = 0.83). The present review supports the use of 
      VLCKD as an effective strategy for the management of overweight and obesity. 
      Future guidelines should include a specific recommendation for this intervention.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current 
      evidence on the role of obesity in the development and progression of chronic 
      kidney disease and the current evidence on nutritional, pharmacological, and 
      surgical strategies for the management of individuals with obesity and chronic 
      kidney disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity can hurt the kidney via direct pathways, 
      through the production of pro-inflammatory adipocytokines, and indirectly due to 
      systemic complications of obesity, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
      hypertension. In particular, obesity can damage the kidney through alterations in 
      renal hemodynamics resulting in glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria and, 
      finally, impairment in glomerular filtratation rate. Several strategies are 
      available for weight loss and maintenance, such as the modification of lifestyle 
      (diet and physical activity), anti-obesity drugs, and surgery therapy, but there 
      are no clinical practice guidelines to manage subjects with obesity and chronic 
      kidney disease. Obesity is an independent risk factor for the progression of 
      chronic kidney disease. In subjects with obesity, weight loss can slow down the 
      progression of renal failure with a significant reduction in proteinuria and 
      improvement in glomerular filtratation rate. Specifically, in the management of 
      subjects with obesity and chronic renal disease, it has been shown that bariatric 
      surgery can prevent the decline in renal function, while further clinical studies 
      are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety on the kidney of weight reducing 
      agents and the very low-calorie ketogenic diet.

AB  - The global prevalence of obesity has significantly increased in most 
      industrialized countries. Anti-obesity drugs are scarce, and indications to 
      change their life style are impractical. Therefore, to identify diets able to 
      produce significantly and maintained weight loss is mandatory. The present work 
      evaluated the efficacy of a very low-calorie-ketogenic (VLCK) diet in obesity. A 
      group of obese patients were randomized into two groups: the VLCK diet group and 
      a standard low-calorie diet (LC group). The follow-up period was 12 months. Both 
      groups received external support, counseling, to perform physical activity and 
      adhered to the diet. The VLCK diet induced a 30-45 days of mild ketosis and 
      significant effects on body weight within 15 days. At 2 months, the weight 
      reductions in the VLCK diet and LC diet groups were 13.6 ± 3.9 and 4.8 ± 2.7 kg, 
      respectively (p < 0.0001). At the end of the study, at 12 months, the weight 
      reductions were 19.9 ± 12.3 and 7.0 ± 5.6 kg, respectively (p < 0.0001), and more 
      than 88 % of patients in the VLCK diet group lost more of 10 % of their initial 
      weight. Lean mass was practically unaffected. The VLCK diet was well tolerated 
      and the side effects were moderate and transitory. In a group of obese patients, 
      the VLCK diet was significantly more effective than a standard LC diet. At one 
      year follow-up in the group with VLCK diet, most of the patients loss more than 
      10 % of their initial weight and lean mass was well preserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials 
      (RCTs) have reported the benefits of ketogenic diets (KD) in various participants 
      such as patients with epilepsy and adults with overweight or obesity. 
      Nevertheless, there has been little synthesis of the strength and quality of this 
      evidence in aggregate. METHODS: To grade the evidence from published 
      meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the association of KD, ketogenic 
      low-carbohydrate high-fat diet (K-LCHF), and very low-calorie KD (VLCKD) with 
      health outcomes, PubMed, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane database of 
      systematic reviews were searched up to February 15, 2023. Meta-analyses of RCTs 
      of KD were included. Meta-analyses were re-performed using a random-effects 
      model. The quality of evidence per association provided in meta-analyses was 
      rated by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluations) criteria as high, moderate, low, and very low. RESULTS: We included 
      17 meta-analyses comprising 68 RCTs (median [interquartile range, IQR] sample 
      size of 42 [20-104] participants and follow-up period of 13 [8-36] weeks) and 115 
      unique associations. There were 51 statistically significant associations (44%) 
      of which four associations were supported by high-quality evidence (reduced 
      triglyceride (n = 2), seizure frequency (n = 1) and increased low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (n = 1)) and four associations supported by 
      moderate-quality evidence (decrease in body weight, respiratory exchange ratio 
      (RER), hemoglobin A(1c), and increased total cholesterol). The remaining 
      associations were supported by very low (26 associations) to low (17 
      associations) quality evidence. In overweight or obese adults, VLCKD was 
      significantly associated with improvement in anthropometric and cardiometabolic 
      outcomes without worsening muscle mass, LDL-C, and total cholesterol. K-LCHF was 
      associated with reduced body weight and body fat percentage, but also reduced 
      muscle mass in healthy participants. CONCLUSIONS: This umbrella review found 
      beneficial associations of KD supported by moderate to high-quality evidence on 
      seizure and several cardiometabolic parameters. However, KD was associated with a 
      clinically meaningful increase in LDL-C. Clinical trials with long-term follow-up 
      are warranted to investigate whether the short-term effects of KD will translate 
      to beneficial effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and 
      mortality.

TI  - The Impact of Nutritional Therapy in the Management of Overweight/Obese PCOS 
      Patient Candidates for IVF.
LID - 10.3390/nu15204444 [doi]
LID - 4444
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrine disorder, 
      and it has two main pathological aspects: reproductive and metabolic. 
      Overweight/obesity is a risk factor in terms of adverse effects during hormone 
      stimulation, a reduced response to ovulation induction regimens, reduced success 
      of IVF, and an increased risk of obstetric complications. To resolve this vicious 
      cycle of pathological events, weight loss and lifestyle modifications are 
      promising strategies. Among these possible approaches, the consumption of a 
      very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) or Mediterranean diet (MD) represents a 
      valid option. In our study, 84 obese/overweight PCOS patients were recruited to 
      evaluate the effects induced by the VLCKD and MD on weight, hormonal, and 
      metabolic parameters. BMI decreased significantly among the VLKCD patients 
      compared to the MD patients (both presenting p values < 0.0001 at 90 and 120 
      days), and a significant reduction in body circumference was observed. At the 
      same time, HOMA index values statistically decreased for the VLCKD patients 
      compared to those on the MD (p value < 0.001 at 90 days and p value < 0.05 at 120 
      days), and this phenomenon was also observed for AFC at 90 and 120 days (both p 
      values < 0.001) and AMH at 90 days (p value < 0.05). Interestingly, the ovarian 
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) incidence was statistically lower in the VLKCD 
      patients compared to the MD patients (p < 0.001). We state that these dietary 
      regimes may improve anthropometric parameters (such as BMI) and women's 
      reproductive health, restore menstrual regularity, and reduce the risk of OHSS. 
      Regarding the different nutritional therapies, the results suggest that the VLCKD 
      is an optimal choice for entry into IVF, especially in terms of the time range in 
      which these results are achieved.

AB  - Brackground:The safety and tolerability of very low-calorie-ketogenic (VLCK) 
      diets are a current concern in the treatment of obese type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) patients. OBJECTIVE: Evaluating the short-term safety and tolerability of 
      a VLCK diet (<50 g of carbohydrate daily) in an interventional weight loss 
      program including lifestyle and behavioral modification support (Diaprokal 
      Method) in subjects with T2DM. METHODS: Eighty-nine men and women, aged between 
      30 and 65 years, with T2DM and body mass index between 30 and 35 kg m(-)(2) 
      participated in this prospective, open-label, multi-centric randomized clinical 
      trial with a duration of 4 months. Forty-five subjects were randomly assigned to 
      the interventional weight loss (VLCK diet), and 44 to the standard low-calorie 
      diet. RESULTS: No significant differences in the laboratory safety parameters 
      were found between the two study groups. Changes in the urine 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio in VLCK diet were not significant and were comparable 
      to control group. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen did not change significantly 
      relative to baseline nor between groups. Weight loss and reduction in waist 
      circumference in the VLCK diet group were significantly larger than in control 
      subjects (both P<0.001). The decline in HbA1c and glycemic control was larger in 
      the VLCK diet group (P<0.05). No serious adverse events were reported and mild AE 
      in the VLCK diet group declined at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      interventional weight loss program based on a VLCK diet is most effective in 
      reducing body weight and improvement of glycemic control than a standard 
      hypocaloric diet with safety and good tolerance for T2DM patients.

TI  - Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) as Pre-Operative First-Line Dietary 
      Therapy in Patients with Obesity Who Are Candidates for Bariatric Surgery.
LID - 10.3390/nu15081907 [doi]
LID - 1907
AB  - Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective method for achieving long-term 
      weight loss and reducing the risk of comorbidities and mortality in individuals 
      with severe obesity. The pre-operative diet is an important factor in determining 
      patients' suitability for surgery, as well as their post-operative outcomes and 
      success in achieving weight loss. Therefore, the nutritional management of 
      bariatric patients requires specialized expertise. Very low-calorie diets and 
      intragastric balloon placement have already been studied and shown to be 
      effective in promoting pre-operative weight loss. In addition, the very 
      low-calorie ketogenic diet has a well-established role in the treatment of 
      obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but its potential role as a pre-operative 
      dietary treatment prior to bariatric surgery has received less attention. Thus, 
      this article will provide a brief overview of the current evidence on the very 
      low-calorie ketogenic diet as a pre-operative dietary treatment in patients with 
      obesity who are candidates for bariatric surgery.

TI  - Obesity and Obesity-Related Thyroid Dysfunction: Any Potential Role for the Very 
      Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD)?
PG  - 194-213
LID - 10.1007/s13668-024-00528-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to explore in-depth the different aspects of 
      the association between very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), obesity and 
      obesity-related thyroid dysfunction. RECENT FINDINGS: The VLCKD, proposed as a 
      non-pharmacological strategy for the management of certain chronic diseases, is 
      becoming increasingly popular worldwide. Initially used to treat epilepsy, it has 
      been shown to be effective in controlling body weight gain and addressing various 
      pathophysiological conditions. Research has shown that a low-calorie, high-fat 
      diet can affect thyroid hormone levels. Weight loss can also influence thyroid 
      hormone levels. Studies have suggested that long-term use of VLCKD for refractory 
      epilepsy may be related to the development of hypothyroidism, with an effect seen 
      in various populations. In particular, women with obesity following VLCKD tend to 
      have reduced T3 levels. We propose further research to unravel the underlying 
      mechanisms linking VLCKD to obesity and obesity-related thyroid dysfunction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is a promising lifestyle 
      intervention for the management of overweight and obesity. It is characterized by 
      a restriction of both calories and carbohydrates, while assuring the adequate 
      proteins, fats and micronutrients intake. Significant results in terms of excess 
      body weight loss have been reported and this strategy considered also in the 
      preoperative settings. Improvements in hypertension, type 2 diabetes and 
      dyslipidemia follows. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed and Google Scholar were 
      searched for papers reporting data on VLCKD as a strategy for the management of 
      overweight, obesity and related disorders in adults. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Four 
      main documents are available in the literature and were included in the present 
      narrative review. CONCLUSIONS: The present review discusses available evidence 
      and provides practical recommendations for the management of VLCKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is accompanied by hormonal, inflammatory and endothelial 
      alterations. These alterations induce a stimulation of several other mechanisms 
      that contribute to the hypertensive state and to increase the cardiovascular 
      morbidity. This pilot, open - label, single- center, prospective clinical trial 
      aimed to evaluate the effect of very low- calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) on blood 
      pressure (BP) in women with of obesity and hypertension. METHODS: A total of 137 
      women, who met the inclusion criteria and accepted to adhere to VLCKD, were 
      consecutively enrolled. Assessment of anthropometric parameters (weight, height, 
      and waist circumference), body composition (through bioelectrical impedance 
      analysis), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and blood sample 
      collection were carried out at baseline and after 45 days of the active phase of 
      VLCKD. RESULTS: After VLCKD all the women experienced a significant reduction in 
      body weight and an overall improvement of body composition parameters. In 
      addition, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs- CRP) levels were significantly 
      diminished (p < 0.001), while phase angle (PhA) increased by almost 9% 
      (p < 0.001). Interestingly, both SBP and DBP were significantly improved (-12.89% 
      and - 10.77%, respectively; p < 0.001). At baseline, SBP and DBP showed 
      statistically significant correlations with body mass index (BMI), waist 
      circumference, hs-CRP levels, PhA, total body water (TBW), extracellular water 
      (ECW), Na / K ratio, and fat mass. Even after VLCKD, all correlations among SBP 
      and DBP with the study variables were statistically significant, except for the 
      association between DBP and Na / K ratio. Changes (%) in both SBP and DBP were 
      associated with ∆BMI%, ∆PhA% and ∆hs- CRP levels (p < 0.001). In addition, only 
      ∆SBP% was associated with ∆waist circumference (p = 0.017), ∆TBW (p = 0.017), and 
      ∆fat mass (p < 0.001); while only ∆DBP% was associated with ∆ECW (p = 0.018), and 
      ∆Na / K ratio (p = 0.048). After adjusting for ∆BMI, ∆WC, ∆PhA, ∆TBW, and ∆fat 
      mass, the correlation between changes in ∆SBP and ∆hs -CRP levels remained 
      statistically significant (p < 0.001). Similarly, the correlation between ∆DBP 
      and ∆hs- CRP levels also remained statistically significant after adjustment for 
      ∆BMI, ∆PhA, ∆Na / K ratio, and ∆ECW (p < 0.001). From multiple regression 
      analysis ∆hs- CRP levels seemed to be the main predictor of changes of BP 
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: VLCKD reduces BP in women with of obesity and 
      hypertension in a safely manner.

TI  - Effects of very low-calorie ketogenic diet on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
      and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
PG  - 1509-1520
LID - 10.1007/s40618-023-02068-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine 
      system involved in controlling stress responses in humans under physiological and 
      pathological conditions; cortisol is the main hormone produced by the HPA axis. 
      It is known that calorie restriction acts as a stressor and can lead to an 
      increase in cortisol production. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a 
      complex endocrine network regulating blood pressure and hydrosaline metabolism, 
      whose final hormonal effector is aldosterone. RAAS activation is linked to 
      cardiometabolic diseases, such as heart failure and obesity. Obesity has become a 
      leading worldwide pandemic, associated with serious health outcomes. Calorie 
      restriction represents a pivotal strategy to tackle obesity. On the other hand, 
      it is well known that an increased activity of the HPA may favour visceral 
      adipose tissue expansion, which may jeopardize a successful diet-induced weight 
      loss. Very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is a normoprotein diet with a 
      drastic reduction of the carbohydrate content and total calorie intake. Thanks to 
      its sustained protein content, VLCKD is extremely effective to reduce adipose 
      tissue while preserving lean body mass and resting metabolic rate. PURPOSE: The 
      purpose of this narrative review is to gain more insights on the effects of VLCKD 
      on the HPA axis and RAAS, in different phases of weight loss and in different 
      clinical settings.

AB  - Severe obesity is associated with an increased risk of admission to intensive 
      care units and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with 
      COVID-19. The association of obesity and COVID-19 prognosis may be related to 
      many different factors, such as chronic systemic inflammation, the predisposition 
      to severe respiratory conditions and viral infections. The ketogenic diet is an 
      approach that can be extremely effective in reducing body weight and visceral fat 
      in the short term, preserving the lean mass and reducing systemic inflammation. 
      Therefore, it is a precious preventive measure for severely obese people and may 
      be considered as an adjuvant therapy for patients with respiratory compromise.

AB  - Since excessive sugar consumption has been related to the development of chronic 
      metabolic diseases prevalent in the western world, the use of sweeteners has 
      gradually increased worldwide over the last few years. Although low- and 
      non-calorie sweeteners may represent a valuable tool to reduce calorie intake and 
      prevent weight gain, studies investigating the safety and efficacy of these 
      compounds in the short- and long-term period are scarce and controversial. 
      Therefore, future studies will need to elucidate the potential beneficial and/or 
      detrimental effects of different types of sweeteners on metabolic health (energy 
      balance, appetite, body weight, cardiometabolic risk factors) in healthy subjects 
      and patients with diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. In this regard, the 
      impact of different sweeteners on central nervous system, gut hormones and gut 
      microbiota is important, given the strong implications that changes in such 
      systems may have for human health. The aim of this narrative review is to 
      summarize the current evidence for the neuroendocrine and metabolic effects of 
      sweeteners, as well as their impact on gut microbiota. Finally, we briefly 
      discuss the advantages of the use of sweeteners in the context of very-low 
      calorie ketogenic diets.

TI  - Very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD): a therapeutic nutritional tool for acne?
PG  - 322
LID - 10.1186/s12967-024-05119-5 [doi]
LID - 322
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne, a chronic inflammatory disease impacting the pilosebaceous 
      unit, is influenced significantly by inflammation and oxidative stress, and is 
      commonly associated with obesity. Similarly, obesity is also associated with 
      increased inflammation and oxidation. The role of diet in acne remains 
      inconclusive, but the very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), known for weight 
      loss and generating anti-inflammatory ketone bodies, presents promising 
      potential. Despite this, the effects of VLCKD on acne remain underexplored. This 
      study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a 45-day active phase of VLCKD in 
      reducing the clinical severity of acne in young women with treatment-naïve 
      moderate acne and grade I obesity. METHODS: Thirty-one women with treatment-naïve 
      moderate acne, grade I obesity (BMI 30.03-34.65 kg/m(2)), aged 18-30 years, 
      meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, and consenting to adhere to VLCKD were 
      recruited. Baseline and post-intervention assessments included anthropometric 
      measurements, body composition, phase angle (PhA), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) 
      levels, and reactive oxygen metabolite derivatives (dROMs) as markers of 
      inflammation, dysbiosis, and oxidative stress, respectively. A comprehensive 
      dermatological examination, incorporating the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) 
      and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), was conducted for all women. 
      RESULTS: VLCKD resulted in general improvements in anthropometric and body 
      composition parameters. Significantly, there were significant reductions in both 
      the GAGS score (Δ%: - 31.46 ± 9.53, p < 0.001) and the DLQI score (Δ%: 
      - 45.44 ± 24.02, p < 0.001) after the intervention. These improvements coincided 
      with significant decreases in TMAO (p < 0.001) and dROMs (p < 0.001) levels and a 
      significant increase in PhA (Δ%: + 8.60 ± 7.40, p < 0.001). Changes in the GAGS 
      score positively correlated with changes in dROMs (p < 0.001) and negatively with 
      PhA (p < 0.001) even after adjusting for Δ% FM. Changes in the DLQI score 
      positively correlated with changes in dROMs (p < 0.001) and negatively with PhA 
      (p < 0.001) even after adjustment for Δ% FM. CONCLUSION: Given the side effects 
      of drugs used for acne, there is an increasing need for safe, tolerable, and 
      low-cost treatments that can be used for acne disease. The 45-day active phase of 
      VLCKD demonstrated notable improvements in acne severity, and these improvements 
      seemed to be attributable to the known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects 
      of VLCKD.

TI  - Ketogenic nutritional therapy (KeNuT)-a multi-step dietary model with meal 
      replacements for the management of obesity and its related metabolic disorders: a 
      consensus statement from the working group of the Club of the Italian Society of 
      Endocrinology (SIE)-diet therapies in endocrinology and metabolism.

AB  - PURPOSE: The ketogenic nutritional therapy (KeNuT) is an effective dietary 
      treatment for patients with obesity and obesity-related comorbidities, including 
      type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and some 
      type of cancers. However, to date an official document on the correct 
      prescription of the ketogenic diet, validated by authoritative societies in 
      nutrition or endocrine sciences, is missing. It is important to emphasize that 
      the ketogenic nutritional therapy requires proper medical supervision for patient 
      selection, due to the complex biochemical implications of ketosis and the need 
      for a strict therapeutic compliance, and an experienced nutritionist for proper 
      personalization of the whole nutritional protocol. METHODS: This practical guide 
      provides an update of main clinical indications and contraindications of 
      ketogenic nutritional therapy with meal replacements and its mechanisms of 
      action. In addition, the various phases of the protocol involving meal 
      replacements, its monitoring, clinical management and potential side effects, are 
      also discussed. CONCLUSION: This practical guide will help the healthcare 
      provider to acquire the necessary skills to provide a comprehensive care of 
      patients with overweight, obesity and obesity-related diseases, using a multistep 
      ketogenic dietary treatment, recognized by the Club of the Italian Society of 
      Endocrinology (SIE)-Diet Therapies in Endocrinology and Metabolism.

TI  - Ketogenic diets as treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 381-397
LID - 10.1007/s11154-020-09580-7 [doi]
AB  - During the last decades, several interventions for the management of overweight 
      and obesity have been proposed. Among diets, the first studies focused on the 
      effect of water only and total fasting diets with or without proteins. 
      Unfortunately, they were found to be associated with adverse events which lead to 
      the abandon of these strategies. Interestingly, despite the radical approach, 
      total fasting was effective and generally well tolerated. A strict connection 
      between protein-calorie malnutrition and increased in morbidity and mortality in 
      hospitalized patients was found at that time. Then, the seminal works of 
      Blackburn and his collaborators lead to the introduction of the protein-sparing 
      modified fast. Encouraged by the early results using this intervention, diets 
      evolved to the current very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD). In the present 
      review, results of studies on the VLCKDs are presented and discussed, with a 
      particular reference to the protocolled VLCKD. Also, a recent proposal on the 
      nomenclature on the ketogenic diets is reported. Available evidence suggests 
      VLCKDs to be effective in achieving a rapid and significant weight loss by means 
      of an easily reversible intervention which could be repeated, if needed. Muscle 
      mass and strength are preserved, resting metabolic rate is not impaired, hunger, 
      appetite and mood are not worsened. Symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings can 
      be there, but they have generally been reported as of mild intensity and 
      transient. Preliminary studies suggest VLCKDs to be a potential game-changer in 
      the management of type 2 diabetes too. Therefore, VLCKDs should be considered as 
      an excellent initial step in properly selected and motivated patients with 
      obesity or type 2 diabetes, to be delivered as a part of a multicomponent 
      strategy and under strict medical supervision.

TI  - The Impact of a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet in the Gut Microbiota Composition 
      in Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/nu15122728 [doi]
LID - 2728
AB  - The very-low-calorie KD (VLCKD) is characterized by a caloric intake of under 800 
      kcal/day divided into less than 50 g/day of carbohydrate (13%) and 1 to 1.5 g of 
      protein/kg of body weight (44%) and 43% of fat. This low carbohydrate intake 
      changes the energy source from glucose to ketone bodies. Moreover, clinical 
      trials have consistently shown a beneficial effect of VLCKD in several diseases, 
      such as heart failure, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and 
      obesity, among others. The gut microbiota has been associated with the metabolic 
      conditions of a person and is regulated by diet interactions; furthermore, it has 
      been shown that the microbiota has a role in body weight homeostasis by 
      regulating metabolism, appetite, and energy. Currently, there is increasing 
      evidence of an association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the 
      pathophysiology of obesity. In addition, the molecular pathways, the role of 
      metabolites, and how microbiota modulation could be beneficial remain unclear, 
      and more research is needed. The objective of the present article is to 
      contribute with an overview of the impact that VLCKD has on the intestinal 
      microbiota composition of individuals with obesity through a literature review 
      describing the latest research regarding the topic and highlighting which 
      bacteria phyla are associated with obesity and VLCKD.

TI  - Effects of an Eight Week Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) on White Blood 
      Cell and Platelet Counts in Relation to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated 
      Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) in Subjects with Overweight and Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/nu15204468 [doi]
LID - 4468
AB  - Obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are 
      frequently associated conditions characterized by low-grade inflammation. Very 
      low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) strategies are commonly used to simultaneously 
      obtain weight loss and an improvement of liver steatosis. We evaluated the 
      efficacy of 8 weeks' VLCKD in decreasing the white blood cell (WBC) and platelet 
      (PLT) counts, as well as liver steatosis and fibrosis, diagnosed using transient 
      elastography (FibroScan). Metabolic and anthropometric parameters commonly 
      associated with MASLD were also evaluated. This study included 87 participants; 
      58 women and 29 men aged between 18 and 64 years with overweight (18%) or obesity 
      (82%), but not taking any medication. Anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance 
      analysis, and biochemical assays were performed before and after the dietary 
      intervention. BMI (kg/m(2)) (p-value < 0.001), waist circumference (cm) (p-value 
      < 0.001), and fat mass (kg) (p-value < 0.001) were significantly decreased 
      following VLCKD. After VLCKD, the FibroScan parameter CAP (db/m), which measures 
      the accumulation of fatty liver, significantly decreased (p-value < 0.001), as 
      did liver stiffness (kPA), the FibroScan parameter quantifying liver fibrosis 
      (p-value < 0.05). Seemingly, WBC (p-value < 0.001) and PLT (p-value < 0.001) 
      counts were lowered by VLCKD in the whole group; however, the decrease in WBC and 
      platelet counts were significant only in patients with steatosis (CAP ≥ 215 
      dB/m). Fasting blood glucose (p-value < 0.001), insulin (p-value < 0.001), HbA1c 
      (p-value < 0.001), triglycerides (p-value < 0.001), total cholesterol (p-value < 
      0.001), LDL-cholesterol (p-value < 0.001), HDL-cholesterol (p-value < 0.001); γGT 
      (p-value < 0.001) blood levels and insulin resistance (as measured by HOMAIR) 
      (p-value < 0.001); and systolic (p-value < 0.001), and diastolic (p-value < 
      0.001) blood pressure levels, were all significantly lower after VLCKD. In 
      contrast, blood levels of vitamin D were higher following the diet (p-value < 
      0.001). We conclude that treating subjects with overweight and obesity with VLCKD 
      is followed by a simultaneous reduction in WBCs and platelets, the expression of 
      low-grade inflammation, and of liver steatosis and fibrosis. Therefore, we can 
      hypothesize that VLCKD decreases general and liver low-grade inflammation, thus 
      improving liver health.

AB  - Ketogenic diets (KD) are dietary strategies low in carbohydrates, normal in 
      protein, and high, normal, or reduced in fat with or without (Very Low-Calories 
      Ketogenic Diet, VLCKD) a reduced caloric intake. KDs have been shown to be useful 
      in the treatment of obesity, metabolic diseases and related disorders, 
      neurological diseases, and various pathological conditions such as cancer, 
      nonalcoholic liver disease, and chronic pain. Several studies have investigated 
      the intracellular metabolic pathways that contribute to the beneficial effects of 
      these diets. Although epigenetic changes are among the most important 
      determinants of an organism's ability to adapt to environmental changes, data on 
      the epigenetic changes associated with these dietary pathways are still limited. 
      This review provides an overview of the major epigenetic changes associated with 
      KDs.

AB  - Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease associated with 
      multiple comorbidities. Considered one of the most common inflammatory skin 
      diseases among the general population, it not only affects the skin, but also 
      negatively impacts other organs and joints. In addition, psoriasis has been 
      associated with several chronic cardio-metabolic diseases such as obesity, which 
      would seem to be (i) a risk factor for the onset of psoriasis and (ii) a 
      worsening factor of the severity of the disease. Weight loss appears to improve 
      severity in overweight patients. Recently proposed as an obesity management 
      nutritional strategy, the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has 
      demonstrated significant effects in reducing inflammatory processes. In the 
      current review, we describe the evidence available on psoriasis and VLCKD, and 
      provide a practical guide to the prescription of VLCKD in the different phases, 
      evaluation and management of possible adverse events, and the importance of 
      physical activity as a lifestyle modification to reduce psoriasis and associated 
      comorbidities. Randomized control trials are, however, necessary to determine the 
      most effective VLCKD protocol for patients with obesity and psoriasis, optimal 
      protocol duration, composition of micronutrients and macronutrients, choice of 
      special supplements, and management of carbohydrate reintroduction.

TI  - Ketogenic diet for epilepsy and obesity: Is it the same?
PG  - 581-589

LID - 10.1016/j.numecd.2024.01.014 [doi]
AB  - The term "ketogenic diet" (KD) is used for a wide variety of diets with diverse 
      indications ranging from obesity to neurological diseases, as if it was the same 
      diet. This terminology is confusing for patients and the medical and scientific 
      community. The term "ketogenic" diet implies a dietary regimen characterized by 
      increased levels of circulating ketone bodies that should be measured in blood 
      (beta-hydroxybutyrate), urine (acetoacetate) or breath (acetone) to verify the 
      "ketogenic metabolic condition". Our viewpoint highlights that KDs used for 
      epilepsy and obesity are not the same; the protocols aimed at weight loss 
      characterized by low-fat, low-CHO and moderate/high protein content are not 
      ketogenic by themselves but may become mildly ketogenic when high calorie 
      restriction is applied. In contrast, there are standardized protocols for 
      neurological diseases treatment for which ketosis has been established to be part 
      of the mechanism of action. Therefore, in our opinion, the term ketogenic dietary 
      therapy (KDT) should be reserved to the protocols considered for epilepsy and 
      other neurological diseases, as suggested by the International Study Group in 
      2018. We propose to adjust the abbreviations in VLCHKD for Very Low CarboHydrate 
      Ketogenic Diet and VLEKD for Very Low Energy Ketogenic Diet, to clarify the 
      differences in dietary composition. We recommend that investigators describe the 
      researchers describing efficacy or side effects of KDs, to clearly specify the 
      dietary protocol used with its unique acronym and level of ketosis, when ketosis 
      is considered as a component of the diet's mechanism of action.

LID - 10.3390/nu14122388 [doi]
LID - 2388
AB  - A very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is characterized by low daily caloric 
      intake (less than 800 kcal/day), low carbohydrate intake (<50 g/day) and 
      normoproteic (1−1.5 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight) contents. It induces a 
      significant weight loss and an improvement in lipid parameters, blood pressure, 
      glycaemic indices and insulin sensitivity in patients with obesity and type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is characterized by an endogenous or 
      exogenous excess of glucocorticoids and shows many comorbidities including 
      cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and lipid disorders. 
      The aim of this speculative review is to provide an overview on nutrition in 
      hypercortisolism and analyse the potential use of a VLCKD for the treatment of CS 
      comorbidities, analysing the molecular mechanisms of ketogenesis.

TI  - Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet: What Effects on Lipid Metabolism?
PG  - 516-526
LID - 10.1007/s13668-024-00556-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to critically examine how VLCKD affects 
      plasma lipoprotein, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Cardiovascular disease is a 
      worldwide health problem affecting millions of people and leading to high rates 
      of mortality and morbidity. There is a well-established association between 
      cardiovascular disease and circulating cholesterol. Various dietary 
      recommendations are currently available for the management of dyslipidemia. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is becoming 
      increasingly popular as a treatment option for several pathological conditions, 
      including dyslipidemia. In addition to being low in calories, the VLCKD's main 
      feature is its unique calorie distribution, emphasizing a reduction in 
      carbohydrate consumption in favor of fat as the primary calorie source. Lowering 
      calorie intake through a VLCKD can reduce the endogenous production of 
      cholesterol. However, if the foods consumed are from animal sources, dietary 
      cholesterol intake may increase due to the higher fat content of animal products. 
      When combined, these dietary practices may have opposing effects on plasma 
      cholesterol levels. Studies investigating the impact of VLCKD on plasma 
      cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels report contradictory 
      findings. While some studies found an increase in low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol levels, others showed a decrease in total cholesterol and low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol, along with an increase in high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol.

TI  - Very low-calorie ketogenic diet rapidly augments testosterone levels in 
      non-diabetic obese subjects.
PG  - 234-244
LID - 10.1111/andr.13357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) represents an opportunity 
      to attain clinically relevant weight loss in obese patients. Functional 
      hypogonadism represents a frequent hormonal disorder associated with obesity and 
      visceral fat accumulation characterised by low testosterone levels and subnormal 
      luteinising hormone (LH) levels. AIM: To evaluate the early effects of VLCKD on 
      serum total testosterone (TT) levels in non-diabetic obese patients. METHODS: 
      Twenty-two obese male patients (mean age 39.3 ± 11.7 years, mean body mass index 
      (BMI) 38.2 ± 6.4 kg/m(2) ) were enrolled and treated for 28 days with VLCKD. 
      Anthropometric and hormonal variables were assessed before, during and after diet 
      intervention. RESULTS: After 7 and 28 days on a VLCKD, a significant and 
      persistent reduction in body weight, BMI, fat mass, blood glucose, insulin and 
      homeostasis model assessment index was observed compared with baseline. TT 
      significantly increased after 7 days (+35 ± 64 ng/dl) and 28 days 
      (+74 ± 97 ng/dl) on a VLCKD. In addition to TT, a significant increase in serum 
      sex hormone-binding globulin levels was observed after 7 (+2.1 ± 4.1) and 28 days 
      (+7.7 ± 10.0). However, both calculated free testosterone and LH did not change 
      after 7 or 28 days of VLCKD. Following cessation of VLCKD, hypogonadal subjects 
      achieved a higher percentage of total weight loss (8.5% ± 1.5%), a greater 
      reduction in weight (-9.94 ± 1.66 kg), fat mass (-7 ± 2.1 kg) and waist 
      circumference (-6.31 ± 2.65 cm) and a greater improvement in glycaemia 
      (-8.75 ± 10.92 mg/dl) as compared with eugonadal subjects. Furthermore, 
      hypogonadal subjects exhibited a trend of higher TT increase 
      (+98.12 ± 71.51 ng/dl) as compared with eugonadal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: VLCKD 
      results in rapid improvements in TT levels associated with weight loss in male 
      obese non-diabetic subjects, particularly in the presence of obesity-related 
      hypogonadism.

TI  - Very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in patients with psoriasis and obesity: 
      an update for dermatologists and nutritionists.
PG  - 398-414
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2020.1818053 [doi]
AB  - Psoriasis is a chronic skin immune-mediated disease with systemic 
      pro-inflammatory activation; both genetic and lifestyles factors contribute to 
      its pathogenesis and severity. In this context, nutrition plays a significant 
      role, per se, in psoriasis' pathogenesis. Obesity is another important risk 
      factor for psoriasis, and weight reduction may improve psoriasis' clinical 
      severity. The excess body weight, particularly visceral fat mass, can affect both 
      drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Therefore, psoriasis and obesity 
      share a certain degree of synergy, and the chronic inflammatory state represents 
      the basis of this vicious cycle. Evidence reported that nutrition has different 
      impact on the clinical severity of psoriasis, though some specific diets have 
      been more investigated in clinical studies compared to others. Diets with 
      systemic anti-inflammatory properties seem to have a higher effect on improving 
      the clinical severity of psoriasis. Of interest, very-low-calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD), through the production of ketone bodies, has been associated with both a 
      significant reduction of body weight and inflammatory state. VLCKD leading to 
      both weight loss and reduction of systemic inflammation may decrease the 
      exacerbation of the clinical manifestations or even it may block the trigger of 
      psoriatic disease. This dietary pattern could represent a potential first-line 
      treatment in psoriatic patients with obesity. The review aims to summarize the 
      current evidence regarding VLCKD and psoriasis with specific reference to 
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of this dietary pattern.

TI  - Metabolomic Profiling of Obese Patients with Altered Intestinal Permeability 
      Undergoing a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet.
LID - 10.3390/nu15245026 [doi]
LID - 5026
AB  - A healthy intestinal permeability facilitates the selective transport of 
      nutrients, metabolites, water, and bacterial products, involving cellular, 
      neural, hormonal, and immune factors. An altered intestinal permeability 
      indicates pathologic phenotypes and is associated with the exacerbation of 
      obesity and related comorbidities. To investigate the impact of altered 
      permeability in obese patients undergoing a calorie-restrictive dietary regimen 
      (VLCKD), we collected urinary and fecal samples from obese patients with both 
      normal and altered permeability (determined based on the lactulose/mannitol 
      ratio) before and after treatment. The analysis of volatile organic compounds 
      (VOCs) aids in understanding the metabolites produced by the intestinal 
      microbiota in this unique ecological niche. Furthermore, we examined clinical and 
      anthropometric variables from the cohort and compared them to significant VOC 
      panels. Consequently, we identified specific markers in the metabolomics data 
      that differentiated between normal and altered profiles before and after the 
      diet. These markers indicated how the variable contribution specifically 
      accounted for interleukins and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The targeted 
      metabolomics experiment detected no differences in measured short-chain fatty 
      acids (SCFA). In summary, our study evaluated metabolomic markers capable of 
      distinguishing low-grade inflammation conditions, exacerbated in more advanced 
      stages of obesity with altered intestinal permeability.

TI  - A New Nomenclature for the Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD): Very 
      Low-Energy Ketogenic Therapy (VLEKT). Ketodiets and Nutraceuticals Expert Panels:

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In an attempt to clarify the most appropriate nomenclature for 
      the very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD), we propose to change the 
      nomenclature and acronym of this medical nutrition therapy. The new definition 
      and acronym proposed by the "KetoNut" panel of experts of the Italian Society of 
      Nutraceuticals (SINut) and the Italian Association of Dietetics and Clinical 
      Nutrition (ADI) is Very Low-Energy Ketogenic Therapy (VLEKT). RECENT FINDINGS: In 
      the last few years, different authors have focused on the issue of confusion in 
      the nomenclature of ketogenic diets. In detail, have been differentiated the 
      VLCKD that provides < 800 kcal per day, which is intended for the weight loss in 
      the medical treatment of obesity, and a eucaloric ketogenic diet, which contains 
      more calories from fat (predominantly unsaturated) and with specific ketogenic 
      ratios, for allow growth in children while helping, at the same time, to 
      establish epileptic seizure control. In recent years, ketogenic diets have 
      attracted great interest for their efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy and 
      other neurological diseases but also in patients with overweight and 
      obesity-related metabolic disorders. Nevertheless, although ketogenic diets are a 
      dietary intervention designed to induce nutritional ketosis, different diets with 
      different macronutrients' composition have been called with this name. The 
      confusion in the nomenclature of ketogenic diets may result in significant bias 
      and mistakes in the interpretation of the current scientific evidence.

TI  - Pre-operative Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) vs. Very Low Calorie Diet 
      (VLCD): Surgical Impact.
PG  - 292-296
LID - 10.1007/s11695-018-3523-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-operative diet may play an important role as far as patients' 
      fitness for surgery, post-operative outcomes, and successful weight loss. Our aim 
      was to compare surgical outcome and weight loss in two groups of patients who 
      were offered two different pre-operative kinds of diet: very low calorie diet 
      (VLCD) and very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD). METHODS: Patients candidate 
      for bariatric surgery (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) were registered and 
      assessed according to pre- and post-diet BMI, operative time, hospital stay, 
      drainage output, and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Patients' preference influenced the 
      type of diet. RESULTS: From January to December 2016, 178 patients (139 F and 39 
      M) were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 43 years. In total, 72 patients 
      were on VLCKD while 106 patients on VLCD. Pre-diet mean BMI was 
      46.3 ± 6.3 kg/m(2) for VLCKD group and 43.1 ± 6.9 kg/m(2) for VLCD group, while 
      immediately pre-op BMI were 43.9 ± 5.9 kg/m(2) and 41.9 ± 6.8 kg/m(2), 
      respectively. Drainage output and hemoglobin levels after surgery resulted 
      significantly correlated with diet induced BMI reduction (141.2 ± 75.8 vs. 
      190.7 ± 183.6 ml, p = 0.032; 13.1 ± 1.2 vs. 12.7 ± 1.5 g/l, p = 0.04). The 
      percentage of patients requiring a hospital stay longer than anticipated 
      (> 3 days) was 2.8% in the VLCKD group and 10.4% in the VLCD group (p = 0.048). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, VLCKD showed better results than VLCD on surgical 
      outcome, influencing drainage output, post-operative hemoglobin levels, and 
      hospital stay.

TI  - Could very low-calorie ketogenic diets turn off low grade inflammation in 
      obesity? Emerging evidence.
PG  - 8320-8336
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2022.2054935 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is an emerging non-communicable disease associated with chronic low-grade 
      inflammation and oxidative stress, compounded by the development of many 
      obesity-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus, and a range of cancers. Originally developed for the treatment of 
      epilepsy in drug non-responder children, the ketogenic diet (KD) is being 
      increasingly used in the treatment of many diseases, including obesity and 
      obesity-related conditions. The KD is a dietary pattern characterized by high fat 
      intake, moderate to low protein consumption, and very low carbohydrate intake 
      (<50 g) that has proved to be an effective and weight-loss tool. In addition, it 
      also appears to be a dietary intervention capable of improving the inflammatory 
      state and oxidative stress in individuals with obesity by means of several 
      mechanisms. The main activity of the KD has been linked to improving 
      mitochondrial function and decreasing oxidative stress. β-hydroxybutyrate, the 
      most studied ketone body, has been shown to reduce the production of reactive 
      oxygen species, improving mitochondrial respiration. In addition, KDs exert 
      anti-inflammatory activity through several mechanisms, e.g., by inhibiting 
      activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, 
      and the inflammatory nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin 
      domain-containing-3, and inhibiting histone deacetylases. Given the rising 
      interest in the topic, this review looks at the underlying anti-inflammatory and 
      antioxidant mechanisms of KDs and their possible recruitment in the treatment of 
      obesity and obesity-related disorders.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity can worsen fibromyalgia (FM) and very low-calorie ketogenic 
      diet (VLCKD) is a potential therapeutic option for diseases that share clinical 
      and pathophysiological features with FM. In this pilot interventional study, we 
      investigated the effects of VLCKD in obese women with FM. METHODS: Female 
      patients with FM and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30  kg/m(2) were eligible for 
      VLCKD. The ketogenic phase (T0 to T8) was followed by progressive reintroduction 
      of carbohydrates (T8 to T20). Changes in BMI, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire 
      (FIQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and 
      36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were evaluated. A change of 14% in FIQ 
      was considered clinically relevant. The longitudinal association between BMI and 
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) was assessed using generalized estimating 
      equations. RESULTS: Twenty women were enrolled. Two discontinued the 
      intervention. The mean age of the 18 patients who reached T20 was 51.3  years and 
      mean BMI was 37.2  kg/m(2). All patients lost weight during the first period of 
      VLCKD and this achievement was maintained at T20. Mean BMI decreased from 37.2  
      kg/m(2) at T0 to 34.8  kg/m(2) at T4, 33.5  kg/m(2) at T8 and 32.1  kg/m(2) at 
      T20 (p < 0.001). A significant reduction of mean FIQ from 61.7 at T0 to 37.0 at 
      T4 and to 38.7 at T8 (p < 0.001) was observed and it was maintained at T20 with a 
      mean FIQ of 39.1 (p = 0.002). Similar results were obtained for HADS, EQ-5D and 
      SF-36. Analysing each participant, the reduction of FIQ was clinically meaningful 
      in 16 patients (89%) at T4, in 13 (72%) at T8 and in 14 (78%) at T20. No 
      significant association was observed between change in BMI and improvement of the 
      PROs over time. Adverse effects were mild and transient. No major safety concerns 
      emerged. CONCLUSION: These are the first data on the efficacy of VLCKD in FM. All 
      patients achieved improvement in different domains of the disease, which was 
      maintained also after carbohydrate reintroduction. Our results suggest that 
      ketosis might exert beneficial effects in FM beyond the rapid weight loss.

AB  - Low carbohydrates diets (LCDs), which provide 20-120 g of carbohydrates per day, 
      have long been used as therapeutic options in the treatment of severe obesity, 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and other morbid conditions, with good results in terms 
      of weight loss and control of the main metabolic parameters, at least in the 
      short and medium term. According to the caloric content and the macronutrient 
      composition, we can classify LCDs in hypocaloric, normoproteic diets [such as the 
      Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) or the protein-sparing modified fasting 
      (PSMF)], hypocaloric, hyperproteic and hyperlipidic diets (e.g., Atkins, Paleo 
      diets…) and normocaloric, normo-/hyperproteic diets (eucaloric KD), the latter 
      mainly used in patients with brain tumors (gliomas) and refractory epilepsy. In 
      addition to LCD diets, another interesting dietary approach which gained 
      attention in the last few decades is fasting and its beneficial effects in terms 
      of modulation of metabolic pathways, cellular processes and hormonal secretions. 
      Due to the impossibility of using fasting regimens for long periods of time, 
      several alternative strategies have been proposed that can mimic the effects, 
      including calorie restriction, intermittent or alternating fasting, and the 
      so-called fasting mimicking diets (FMDs). Recent preclinical studies have shown 
      positive effects of FMDs in various experimental models of tumors, diabetes, 
      Alzheimer Disease, and other morbid conditions, but to date, the scientific 
      evidence in humans is limited to some opens studies and case reports. The purpose 
      of our narrative review is to offer an overview of the characteristics of the 
      main dietary regimens applied in the treatment of different clinical conditions 
      as well as of the scientific evidence that justifies their use, focusing on low 
      and zero-carb diets and on the different types of fasting.

TI  - Very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in the management of hidradenitis 
      suppurativa (Acne Inversa): an effective and safe tool for improvement of the 
      clinical severity of disease. Results of a pilot study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), an inflammatory-based dermatological 
      condition often associated with obesity, poses significant challenges in 
      management. The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has shown efficacy in 
      addressing obesity, related metabolic disorders, and reducing chronic 
      inflammation. However, its effects on HS remain underexplored. In this 
      prospective pilot study, we aimed to investigate the impact of a 28-day active 
      phase of VLCKD on HS in a sample of treatment-naive women with HS and excess 
      weight. METHODS: Twelve women with HS and overweight or obesity (BMI 27.03 to 
      50.14 kg/m(2)), aged 21 to 54 years, meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
      agreeing to adhere to VLCKD, were included. Baseline lifestyle habits were 
      assessed. The Sartorius score was used to evaluate the clinical severity of HS. 
      Anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, weight, height, and body mass 
      index), body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis, levels of 
      trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and 
      derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) were assessed at baseline and 
      after 28 days of the active phase of VLCKD. RESULTS: VLCKD led to general 
      improvements in anthropometric parameters and body composition. Notably, a 
      significant reduction in the Sartorius score was observed after the intervention 
      (Δ%: - 24.37 ± 16.64, p < 0.001). This reduction coincided with significant 
      decreases in TMAO (p < 0.001), dROMs (p = 0.001), and oxLDL (p < 0.001) levels. 
      Changes in the Sartorius score exhibited positive correlations with changes in 
      TMAO (p < 0.001), dROMs (p < 0.001), and oxLDL (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The 
      28-day active phase of VLCKD demonstrated notable improvements in HS severity and 
      associated metabolic markers, highlighting the potential utility of VLCKD in 
      managing HS and its association with metabolic derangements in women with 
      overweight or obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a condition that is often associated with sleep disorders, 
      including reduced sleep quality (SQ). Very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has 
      proven to be effective in the management of obesity and associated metabolic 
      disorders. However, little is still known about the effects of this promising 
      nutritional protocol on SQ. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate 
      the short-term effect of VLCKD on SQ in women with overweight/obesity and if any 
      changes, to identify the predictive factor that through VLCKD modified SQ. 
      METHODS: Were consecutively enrolled a total of 324 subjects, who met the 
      inclusion criteria and accepted to adhere to VLCKD. Assessment of nutritional 
      status, including anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist 
      circumference), bioelectrical impedance analysis (phase-sensitive system, 50 kHz 
      BIA 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy Akern), high sensitivity C 
      reactive protein levels (hs-CRP), and SQ were carried out at baseline and after 
      31 days of active stage of VLCKD. SQ was evaluated using the validated 
      questionnaire Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: In addition to the 
      expected general improvement of anthropometric parameters and body composition, 
      VLCKD improved significantly SQ, as demonstrated by the improvement of all 
      parameters included in the PSQI questionnaire (p < 0.001). Both at baseline and 
      after 31 days of active stage of VLCKD, the PSQI score was significantly 
      associated with BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, fat free mass (p < 0.001 for 
      all) and hs-CRP (p = 0.023). PhA was negatively associated with PSQI score only 
      at baseline (p < 0.001). ∆% PSQI positively correlated with ∆% BMI, ∆% fat mass, 
      ∆% hs-CRP (p < 0.001 for all) and negatively correlated with ∆% fat free mass 
      (p < 0.001), and ∆% PhA (p = 0.031). In the multiple regression analysis ∆% fat 
      mass represented the only predictor of changes in SQ after VLCKD. Finally, in the 
      ROC analysis, a threshold value of ∆% fat mass > - 8.4% predicted improvement in 
      SQ (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, VLCKD determines an improvement of SQ 
      in women with overweight and obesity, that was mostly mediated by the reduction 
      of fat mass related to this nutritional protocol.

TI  - Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet Modulates the Autonomic Nervous System Activity 
      through Salivary Amylase in Obese Population Subjects.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18168475 [doi]
LID - 8475
AB  - In obesity, to reduce visceral adipose tissue (VAT), caloric restriction is a 
      valid strategy. Salivary amylase is an enzyme that cleaves large starch 
      carbohydrates molecules and its production is modulated by the central nervous 
      system. In addition, heart rate variability (HRV) is simply a measure of the 
      variation in time between each heartbeat. This variation is controlled by the 
      autonomic nervous system. In the light of this evidence, the aim of this study is 
      to characterize the effect of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) on the 
      autonomic nervous system in obese patients. Twenty subjects affected by obesity 
      were recruited before and after 8 weeks of VLCKD intervention to evaluate 
      salivary amylase by the ELISA test and HRV analysis. These parameters 
      significantly increased after dietary treatment, and positively correlate to each 
      other. VLCKD exerts a positive effect on salivary amylase and HRV, ameliorating 
      body composition and biochemical features. In brief, this dietary intervention 
      improves the autonomic nervous system activity. This is the first study about the 
      effects of VLCKD upon the autonomic nervous system, but further studies are 
      needed to elucidate the mechanism undergone VLCKD effects.

TI  - Severe type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission using a very low-calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD).
LID - 22-0295 [pii]
LID - 10.1530/EDM-22-0295 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: There is a close association between obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
      The value of weight loss in the management of patients with T2D has long been 
      known. Loss of 15% or more of body weight can have a disease-modifying effect in 
      people with diabetes inducing remission in a large proportion of patients. Very 
      low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) have been proposed as an appealing 
      nutritional strategy for obesity management. The diet was shown to result in 
      significant weight loss in the short, intermediate, and long terms and 
      improvement in body composition parameters as well as glycemic and lipid 
      profiles. The reported case is a 35-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia, and 
      T2D for 5 years. Despite the use of five antidiabetic medications, including 
      insulin, HbA1c was 10.1%. A VLCKD through a commercial multidisciplinary weight 
      loss program (PnK method) was prescribed and all medications were discontinued. 
      The method is based on high-biological-value protein preparations and has 5 
      steps, the first 3 steps (active stage) consist of a VLCKD (600-800 kcal/d) that 
      is low in carbohydrates (<50 g daily from vegetables) and lipids. The amount of 
      proteins ranged between 0.8 and 1.2 g/kg of ideal body weight. After only 3 
      months, the patient lost 20 kg with weight normalization and diabetes remission, 
      and after 2 years of follow-up, the patient remained without the pathologies. Due 
      to the rapid and significant weight loss, VLCKD emerges as a useful tool in T2D 
      remission in patients with obesity. LEARNING POINTS: Obesity and type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D) are conditions that share key pathophysiological mechanisms. Loss of 15% or 
      more of body weight can have a disease-modifying effect in people with T2D 
      inducing remission in a large proportion of patients. Diabetes remission should 
      be defined as a return of HbA1c to <6.5% and which persists for at least 3 months 
      in the absence of usual glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. The very 
      low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is a nutritional approach that has 
      significant beneficial effects on anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Due to 
      the rapid and significant weight loss, VLCKD emerges as a useful tool in T2D 
      remission in patients with obesity.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the prevalence of obesity 
      tripled worldwide since 1975. Obesity prevention and treatment is based upon 
      lifestyle changes involving eating habits, physical activity and behaviour 
      therapy. Various dietary patterns have been used as nutritional strategies and, 
      in recent years, interest has been shown in very low calorie ketogenic diets 
      (VLCKD) that provide less than 800 calories (kcal), no more than 20-50 g/day of 
      carbohydrates and 0.8-1.5 g/kg ideal body weight of protein. We conducted a 
      literature review of all clinical trials published between January 2014-November 
      2019 on people with obesity (PWO) that evaluated VLCKD effects on anthropometric 
      parameters, body composition, satiety, lipid profile and microbiota. Findings 
      from literature showed that VLCKD could be useful to ameliorate the quality of 
      life and sleep of PWO. It leads to a rapid weight loss and results in 
      improvements in body mass index (BMI = kg/m(2)), waist circumference and fat mass 
      reduction preserving lean body mass and resting metabolic rate. This eating 
      pattern reduced the desire to eat and increased satiety. Little is known 
      regarding the effects of VLCKD on the microbiota of PWO for which it is important 
      to conduct further studies.

TI  - The Role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids in the Interplay between a Very Low-Calorie 
      Ketogenic Diet and the Infant Gut Microbiota and Its Therapeutic Implications for 
      Reducing Asthma.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21249580 [doi]
LID - 9580
AB  - Gut microbiota is well known as playing a critical role in inflammation and 
      asthma development. The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is suggested to 
      affect gut microbiota; however, the effects of VLCKD during pregnancy and 
      lactation on the infant gut microbiota are unclear. The VLCKD appears to be more 
      effective than caloric/energy restriction diets for the treatment of several 
      diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. However, whether adherence to VLCKD 
      affects the infant gut microbiota and the protective effects thereof on asthma 
      remains uncertain. The exact mechanisms underlying this process, and in 
      particular the potential role of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are still to be 
      unravelled. Thus, the aim of this review is to identify the potential role of 
      SCFAs that underlie the effects of VLCKD during pregnancy and lactation on the 
      infant gut microbiota, and explore whether it incurs significant implications for 
      reducing asthma.

TI  - Predictors of weight loss in patients with obesity treated with a Very 
      Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet.
PG  - 1058364

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) has emerged as a safe 
      and effective intervention for the management of metabolic disease. Studies 
      examining weight loss predictors are scarce and none has investigated such 
      factors upon VLCKD treatment. Among the molecules involved in energy homeostasis 
      and, more specifically, in metabolic changes induced by ketogenic diets, 
      Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) is a hepatokine with physiology that is still 
      unclear. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of a VLCKD on weight loss and metabolic 
      parameters and assessed weight loss predictors, including FGF21. VLCKD is a 
      severely restricted diet (<800 Kcal/die), characterized by a very low 
      carbohydrate intake (<50 g/day), 1.2-1.5 g protein/kg of ideal body weight and 
      15-30 g of fat/day. We treated 34 patients with obesity with a VLCKD for 45 days. 
      Anthropometric parameters, body composition, and blood and urine chemistry were 
      measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: We found a significant improvement 
      in body weight and composition and most metabolic parameters. Circulating FGF21 
      decreased significantly after the VLCKD [194.0 (137.6-284.6) to 167.8 
      (90.9-281.5) p < 0.001] and greater weight loss was predicted by lower baseline 
      FGF21 (Beta = -0.410; p = 0.012), male sex (Beta = 0.472; p = 0.011), and central 
      obesity (Beta = 0.481; p = 0.005). DISCUSSION: VLCKD is a safe and effective 
      treatment for obesity and obesity related metabolic derangements. Men with 
      central obesity and lower circulating FGF21 may benefit more than others in terms 
      of weight loss obtained following this diet. Further studies investigating 
      whether this is specific to this diet or to any caloric restriction are 
      warranted.

TI  - The Effects of Eight Weeks' Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) on Liver 
      Health in Subjects Affected by Overweight and Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/nu15040825 [doi]
LID - 825
AB  - Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) are widely employed in successful 
      weight-loss strategies. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a VLCKD 
      on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and parameters commonly associated 
      with this condition in overweight and obese subjects who did not take any drugs. 
      This prospective, real-life study included thirty-three participants who followed 
      a VLCKD for 8 weeks. NAFLD was diagnosed using transient elastography 
      (FibroScan). Data on anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analysis, and 
      biochemical assays were gathered both before and after the dietary intervention. 
      BMI (kg/m(2)) (from 33.84 ± 6.55 to 30.89 ± 6.38, p < 0.01), waist circumference 
      (cm) (from 106.67 ± 15.51 to 98.64 ± 16.21, p < 0.01), and fat mass (Kg) (from 
      38.47 ± 12.59 to 30.98 ± 12.39, p < 0.01) were significantly lower after VLCKD. 
      CAP (db/m), the FibroScan parameter quantifying fatty liver accumulation, showed 
      a significant reduction after VLCKD (from 266.61 ± 67.96 to 223 ± 64.19, p < 
      0.01). After VLCKD, the fatty liver index (FLI), a benchmark of steatosis, also 
      revealed a significant decline (from 62.82 ± 27.46 to 44.09 ± 31.24, p < 0.01). 
      Moreover, fasting blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, 
      LDL-cholesterol, ALT, γGT, and FT3 blood concentrations, as well as insulin 
      resistance (quantified by HOMAIR) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      levels, were significantly lower after VLCKD (p < 0.01 for all the parameters). 
      By contrast, HDL-cholesterol, 25 (OH) vitamin D, and FT4 blood concentrations 
      were higher after VLCKD (p < 0.01 for all parameters). The variation (δ) of CAP 
      after VLCKD did not show a correlation with the δ of any other parameter 
      investigated in this study. We conclude that VLCKD is a helpful approach for 
      NAFLD independent of changes in factors commonly associated with NAFLD (obesity, 
      fat mass, insulin resistance, lipids, and blood pressure) as well as vitamin D 
      and thyroid hormone levels.

TI  - Beneficial Effects of the Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on the Symptoms of Male 
      Accessory Gland Inflammation.
LID - 10.3390/nu14051081 [doi]
LID - 1081
AB  - Introduction. Obesity exposes individuals to the risk of chronic inflammation of 
      the prostate gland. Aim and design of the study. A longitudinal clinical study 
      was conducted on selected overweight/obese patients with male accessory gland 
      inflammation (MAGI) to evaluate the effects of body weight loss on their 
      urogenital symptoms. Materials and methods. One hundred patients were selected 
      and assigned to two groups undergoing two different nutritional programs. The 
      first group (n = 50) started a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and the second (n = 
      50) a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD). Before and after three months on 
      the diet, each patient was evaluated for body weight, waist circumference, and 
      MAGI symptoms. The MAGI was assessed using the Structured Interview about MAGI 
      (SI-MAGI), a questionnaire previously designed to assess the symptoms of MAGI. 
      The questionnaire explores four domains, including urinary symptoms, ejaculatory 
      pain or discomfort, sexual dysfunction, and impaired quality of life. Finally, in 
      the two groups, the frequency of an α-blocker used to treat urinary tract 
      symptoms was also evaluated. Results. Patients on MedDiet experienced significant 
      amelioration in urinary symptoms and quality of life. Patients under VLCKD 
      reported not only significant improvement of the same parameters, but also in 
      ejaculatory pain/discomfort and sexual dysfunction. Finally, the percentage of 
      patients on VLCKD taking the α-blocker decreased significantly. Moreover, 
      patients under VLCKD showed a greater loss of body weight than those following 
      the MedDiet. Discussion. The results of this study support the effectiveness of 
      VLCKD in improving the symptoms of patients with MAGI. This improvement involved 
      all of the domains of the SI-MAGI questionnaire and became manifest in a 
      relatively short time. We suggest that a ketogenic nutritional approach can be 
      used in overweight/obese patients with MAGI.

TI  - Higher-Level Steatosis Is Associated with a Greater Decrease in Metabolic 
      Dysfunction-Associated Steatoic Liver Disease after Eight Weeks of a Very 
      Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) in Subjects Affected by Overweight and 
      Obesity.

AB  - The most common form of chronic liver disease, recently defined as MASLD, is 
      strongly linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes are part of 
      MASLD prevention. The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is a useful option 
      for treating MASLD and reducing liver steatosis in patients with obesity. We 
      assessed whether a greater degree of steatosis could have a positive or negative 
      impact on how well 8 weeks of using the VLCKD improve steatosis and fibrosis in a 
      patient population of overweight and obese individuals. Anthropometric 
      parameters, along with changes in hormone and metabolic biomarkers, were also 
      assessed both before and after the dietary change. The study population included 
      111 overweight (14.41%) or obese subjects (85.59%) aged between 18 and 64 years; 
      the 75 women and 36 men involved were not taking any medicine. In both the raw 
      (0.37 95% CI 0.21; 0.52) and the multivariate models (model a: 0.439 95% CI 0.26; 
      0.62; model b: 0.437 95% CI 0.25; 0.63), there was a positive and statistically 
      significant correlation between the CAP delta value and the CAP before using the 
      VLCKD. Additionally, the liver stiffness delta was found to be positively and 
      statistically significantly correlated with liver stiffness before the use of the 
      VLCKD in both models: the multivariate model (model a: 0.560 95% CI 0.40; 0.71; 
      model b: 0.498 95% CI 0.34; 0.65) and the raw model (0.52 95% CI 0.39; 0.65). 
      Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin resistance (measured by HOMA-IR), 
      insulin, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL 
      cholesterol and triglycerides, BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass, were all 
      decreased (p < 0.001) following the use of the VLCKD. However, following the use 
      of the VLCKD, there was an increase in vitamin D levels. (p < 0.001). We found 
      that using the VLCKD for 8 weeks has a greater effect on improving steatosis and 
      fibrosis in subjects who initially have more severe forms of these conditions.

TI  - The Effect of Three Different Ketogenic Diet Protocols on Migraine and Fatigue in 
      Chronic and High-Frequency Episodic Migraine: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu15204334 [doi]
LID - 4334
AB  - AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of three different ketogenic diets on 
      migraine and fatigue in chronic and high-frequency episodic migraineurs. METHODS: 
      76 patients with migraine were treated with the KD for at least three months. 
      Three different KD protocols were used (2:1 KD, LGID, and VLCKD). We evaluated 
      the fatigue severity scale (FSS), migraine frequency, migraine intensity, MIDAS, 
      and HIT-6 at the baseline and 3-month follow-up, and we compared the results. We 
      also correlated the mean FSS reduction with the mean migraine frequency, migraine 
      intensity, BMI, fat mass, free-fat mass, MIDAS, and HIT-6 reduction. RESULTS: FSS 
      improved from 4.977 ± 1.779 to 3.911 ± 1.779 at the 3-month follow-up (p < 
      0.001). This improvement was significant in both high-frequency and chronic 
      migraineurs. Moreover, the three KD protocols effectively improved migraine 
      intensity, frequency, MIDAS, and HIT-6. There was a mild correlation between mean 
      FSS reduction (p < 0.001), mean MIDAS (p = 0.001), and HIT-6 (p = 0.002) 
      reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The VLCKD, LGID, and 2:1 KD may improve migraine 
      intensity, frequency, and fatigue in chronic and high-frequency episodic 
      migraineurs.

TI  - Ketogenic Diet for Preoperative Weight Reduction in Bariatric Surgery: A 
      Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu14173610 [doi]
LID - 3610
AB  - Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective treatment in reducing weight and the 
      burden of comorbidities in patients with severe obesity. Despite the overall low 
      mortality rate, intra- and post-operative complications remains quite common. 
      Weight loss before BS reduces surgical risk, but studies are inconclusive 
      regarding which is the best approach to apply. In this review, we summarize the 
      current evidence on the effect of a ketogenic diet (KD) before BS. All studies 
      agree that KD leads to considerable weight loss and important improvements in 
      terms of surgical risk, but populations, interventions and outcomes are very 
      heterogeneous. KD appears to be a safe and effective approach to induce weight 
      loss before BS. However, randomized controlled trials with better-defined dietary 
      protocols and homogeneous outcomes are necessary in order to draw firm 
      conclusions.

TI  - Chronotype as a predictor of weight loss and body composition improvements in 
      women with overweight or obesity undergoing a very low-calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Recent studies reported that chronotype play a role in the 
      development of metabolic comorbidities and in determining dietary habits in 
      obesity. However, little is known if chronotype could predict the efficacy of 
      nutritional approaches for obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate 
      whether chronotype categories can have a role in determining the efficacy of very 
      low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in terms of weight loss and changes of body 
      composition in women with overweight or obesity. METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study we analyzed data from 248 women (BMI 36.03 ± 5.20 kg/m(2), aged 
      38.76 ± 14.05 years) clinically referred for weight loss and who completed a 
      VLCKD program. In all women, we assessed anthropometric parameters (weight, 
      height, and waist circumference), body composition and phase angle (through 
      bioimpedance analysis, Akern BIA 101) at the baseline and after 31 days of active 
      phase of VLCKD. Chronotype score was assessed using Morningness-Eveningness 
      questionnaire (MEQ) at baseline. RESULTS: After 31 days of active phase of VLCKD 
      all enrolled women experienced significant weight loss (p < 0.001) and reduction 
      of BMI (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p < 0.001), fat mass (kg and %) 
      (p < 0.001), and free fat mass (kg) (p < 0.001). Women with evening chronotype 
      experienced significantly less weight loss (p < 0.001) and reduced fat mass (kg 
      and %) (p < 0.001), increased fat free mass (kg and %) (p < 0.001) and phase 
      angle (p < 0.001) than women with morning chronotype. In addition, chronotype 
      score correlated negatively with percentage changes in weight (p < 0.001), BMI 
      (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p < 0.001) and fat mass (p < 0.001) and 
      positively with fat free mass (p < 0.001) and phase angle (p < 0.001) from 
      baseline to the 31st day of active phase of VLCKD. Using a linear regression 
      model, chronotype score (p < 0.001) was the main predictors of weight loss 
      achieved with VLCKD. CONCLUSION: Evening chronotype is associated with a lower

TI  - A Randomized Double-Blind, Cross-Over Trial of very Low-Calorie Diet in 
      Overweight Migraine Patients: A Possible Role for Ketones?
LID - 10.3390/nu11081742 [doi]
LID - 1742
AB  - Here we aimed at determining the therapeutic effect of a very low-calorie diet in 
      overweight episodic migraine patients during a weight-loss intervention in which 
      subjects alternated randomly between a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) 
      and a very low-calorie non-ketogenic diet (VLCnKD) each for one month. In a 
      nutritional program, 35 overweight obese migraine sufferers were allocated 
      blindly to 1-month successive VLCKD or VLCnKD in random order (VLCKD-VLCnKD or 
      VLCnKD-VLCD). The primary outcome measure was the reduction of migraine days each 
      month compared to a 1-month pre-diet baseline. Secondary outcome measures were 
      50% responder rate for migraine days, reduction of monthly migraine attacks, 
      abortive drug intake and body mass index (BMI) change. Only data from the 
      intention-to-treat cohort (n = 35) will be presented. Patients who dropped out (n 
      = 6) were considered as treatment failures. Regarding the primary outcome, during 
      the VLCKD patients experienced -3.73 (95% CI: -5.31, -2.15) migraine days respect 
      to VLCnKD (p < 0.0001). The 50% responder rate for migraine days was 74.28% 
      (26/35 patients) during the VLCKD period, but only 8.57% (3/35 patients) during 
      VLCnKD. Migraine attacks decreased by -3.02 (95% CI: -4.15, -1.88) during VLCKD 
      respect to VLCnKD (p < 0.00001). There were no differences in the change of acute 
      anti-migraine drug consumption (p = 0.112) and BMI (p = 0.354) between the 2 
      diets. A VLCKD has a preventive effect in overweight episodic migraine patients 
      that appears within 1 month, suggesting that ketogenesis may be a useful 
      therapeutic strategy for migraines.

TI  - The Role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Mediating Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic 
      Diet-Infant Gut Microbiota Relationships and Its Therapeutic Potential in 
      Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/nu13113702 [doi]
LID - 3702
AB  - As the very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) gains increased interest as a 
      therapeutic approach for many diseases, little is known about its therapeutic use 
      in childhood obesity. Indeed, the role of VLCKD during pregnancy and lactation in 
      influencing short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and the potential 
      mechanisms involved in the protective effects on obesity are still unclear. 
      Infants are characterized by a diverse gut microbiota composition with higher 
      abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria. Maternal VLCKD during pregnancy and 
      lactation stimulates the growth of diverse species of SCFA-producing bacteria, 
      which may induce epigenetic changes in infant obese gene expression and modulate 
      adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. Therefore, this review aims to determine 
      the mechanistic role of SCFAs in mediating VLCKD-infant gut microbiota 
      relationships and its protective effects on obesity.

TI  - Impact of a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) on Changes in Handgrip 
      Strength in Women with Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/nu14194213 [doi]
LID - 4213
AB  - The preservation of muscle mass, which is positively associated with muscle 
      strength, has been included among the benefits of ketogenic diets due to the 
      synergistic effects exerted by the reduction in visceral adipose tissue and 
      obesity-related pro-inflammatory status. The handgrip strength (HGS) test is 
      widely used as a single indicator to represent overall muscle strength. The 
      possible association of changes in HGS in patients with obesity during the 
      consumption of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has not yet been 
      investigated. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy of 
      VLCKD on promoting changes in HGS and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
      (hs-CRP) levels, as a serological marker of obesity-related, low-grade 
      inflammation, in a population of women with obesity after 45 days of active phase 
      of the VLCKD. This pilot, uncontrolled, single-center, open-label clinical trial 
      examined 247 Caucasian women, aged 18−51 years (body mass index, BMI: 30.0−50.9 
      kg/m2) who were consecutively enrolled following 45 days of active phase the 
      VLCKD. Anthropometric measures and physical activity were evaluated. Muscle 
      strength was measured by HGS using a grip strength dynamometer. Body composition 
      was evaluated using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive 
      system. hs-CRP levels were determined by nephelometric assay. Adherence to the 
      VLCKD, ketosis status, and physical activity were checked weekly by phone call. 
      At day 45, BMI, fat mass (FM), and hs-CRP levels were significantly decreased 
      (∆-7.5 ± 3.1%, ∆-15.6 ± 9.0%, and ∆-39.9 ± 44.6%; respectively; p < 0.001 for all 
      three parameters), while HGS had increased (∆+17.4 ± 13.2%; p < 0.001). After 
      adjusting for ∆BMI, ∆waist circumference, ∆hs-CRP levels, and physical activity, 
      the correlation among changes in ∆HGS (kg), ∆FM (kg), and ∆ fat free mass (FFM) 
      (kg) remained statistically significant (r = −0.331, and r = 0.362, respectively; 
      p < 0.001). Interestingly, the correlation between ∆HGS with ∆FM (r = −0.288, p < 
      0.001) and ∆FFM (r = 0.395, p < 0.001) were also independent of the percentage of 
      weight loss. We are the first to report that, along with a significant reduction 
      in body weight and an overall improvement in body composition and inflammatory 
      status, the muscle strength evaluated by the HGS test increased in a population 
      of women with obesity after 45 days of the active phase of the VLCKD, also 
      following adjustment for common confounding variables.

TI  - Very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet before bariatric surgery: prospective 
      evaluation of a sequential diet.
PG  - 64-71
LID - 10.1007/s11695-014-1348-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness of a sequential diet regimen termed 
      the obese preoperative diet (OPOD) in morbidly obese patients with and without 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. 
      METHODS: Fifty patients (body mass index 53.5 ± 8.4 kg/m(2)) scheduled for 
      bariatric surgery, including 14 with T2DM, were prospectively enrolled and 
      followed the OPOD regimen: a very low-calorie ketogenic diet for 10 days, 
      followed by a very low-calorie diet for 10 days, and then a low-calorie diet for 
      10 days. Patients were evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 10 days (T1), 20 days 
      (T2), and 30 days (T3). RESULTS: Body weight, body mass index, waist 
      circumference, and neck circumference were significantly lower at T1, T2, and T3 
      than at T0 in the 48 patients who completed the OPOD. Two patients discontinued 
      the OPOD after 4-7 days. In patients with T2DM, fasting plasma glucose levels 
      decreased significantly, enabling reduction of diabetic medications. Plasma and 
      urine ketone levels increased at T1 but were all <1 mmol/L, and hunger decreased 
      during the diet period. CONCLUSIONS: OPOD, including 10 days of a VLCKD, was safe 
      and effective in morbidly obese patients, and it seems to be promising in 
      morbidly obese patients with and without T2DM scheduled for laparoscopic 
      bariatric surgery.

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on Weight Regain 
      Following Bariatric Surgery.
PG  - 5383-5390
LID - 10.1007/s11695-021-05703-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Obesity is one of the major public health problems worldwide and 
      bariatric surgery is considered the gold standard treatment for severe obesity. 
      Although the literature supports the safety and efficacy of the very low-calorie 
      ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in patients with obesity, there is no study analyzing the 
      use in case of failure or weight regain after bariatric surgery. This work has 
      the purpose of assessing the response to a VLCKD (Pnk® method) in this 
      population. METHODS: We have conducted an observational, retrospective, and 
      descriptive study with the analysis of medical charts of private offices where 
      patients were examined between 2014 and 2019, totalizing 11 participants who 
      underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) without a reduction of 50% in body 
      weight excess or any weight regain after the surgery. The patients followed the 
      first stage of a commercial weight loss program (Pnk® method) which consists of a 
      VLCKD (600-800 kcal/day), low in carbohydrates and lipids. RESULTS: A significant 
      reduction was observed (p-value < 0.05) in weight, body mass index (BMI), 
      abdominal circumference (AC), and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) post-ketogenic diet. 
      Uric acid, transaminases, urea, and creatinine values did not show differences 
      between pre- and post-ketosis. During the course of the study, no serious adverse 
      events were reported. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the ketogenic diet 
      can be recommended as an effective and safe treatment for patients who progressed 
      with insufficient weight loss or regain after bariatric surgery.

TI  - Efficacy of very low-calorie ketogenic diet with the Pronokal® method in obese 
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a 16-week randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1530/EC-22-0536 [doi]
LID - e220536
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study isto assess the efficacy of a very low-calorie 
      ketogenic diet (VLCKD) method vs a Mediterranean low-calorie diet (LCD) in obese 
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women of a reproductive age. DESIGN: Randomized 
      controlled open-label trial was performed in this study. The treatment period was 
      16 weeks; VLCKD for 8 weeks then LCD for 8 weeks, according to the Pronokal® 
      method (experimental group; n = 15) vs Mediterranean LCD for 16 weeks (control 
      group; n = 15). Ovulation monitoring was carried out at baseline and after 16 
      weeks, while a clinical exam, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), 
      anthropometry, and biochemical analyses were performed at baseline, at week 8, 
      and at week 16. RESULTS: BMI decreased significantly in both groups and to a 
      major extent in the experimental group (-13.7% vs -5.1%, P = 0.0003). Significant 
      differences between the experimental and the control groups were also observed in 
      the reduction of waist circumference (-11.4% vs -2.9%), BIA-measured body fat 
      (-24.0% vs -8.1%), and free testosterone (-30.4% vs -12.6%) after 16 weeks (P = 
      0.0008, P = 0.0176, and P = 0.0009, respectively). Homeostatic model assessment 
      for insulin resistance significantly decreased only in the experimental group (P 
      = 0.0238) but without significant differences with respect to the control group 
      (-23% vs -13.2%, P > 0.05). At baseline, 38.5% of participants in the 
      experimental group and 14.3% of participants in the control group had ovulation, 
      which increased to 84.6% (P = 0.031) and 35.7% (P > 0.05) at the end of the 
      study, respectively. CONCLUSION: In obese PCOS patients, 16 weeks of VLCKD 
      protocol with the Pronokal® method was more effective than Mediterranean LCD in 
      reducing total and visceral fat, and in ameliorating hyperandrogenism and 
      ovulatory dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTS: To the best of our knowledge, 
      this is the first randomized controlled trial on the use of the VLCKD method in 
      obese PCOS. It demonstrates the superiority of VLCKD with respect to 
      Mediterranean LCD in reducing BMI with an almost selective reduction of fat mass 
      and a unique effect of VLCKD in reducing visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, 
      and in increasing SHBG with a consequent reduction of free testosterone. 
      Interestingly, this study also demonstrates the superiority of the VLCKD protocol 
      in improving ovulation, whose occurrence increased by 46.1% in the group treated 
      by the VLCKD method against a rise of 21.4% in the group treated by Mediterranean 
      LCD. This study extends the therapeutic approach possibilities in obese PCOS 
      women.

TI  - Efficacy, feasibility and tolerability of ketogenic diet for the treatment of 
      poor response to bariatric surgery.
PG  - 1807-1814

AB  - PURPOSE: Poor response to bariatric surgery, namely insufficient weight loss 
      (IWL) or weight regain (WR), is a critical issue in the treatment of obesity. The 
      purpose of our study was to assess the efficacy, feasibility, and tolerability of 
      very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) for the management of this condition. 
      METHODS: A real-life prospective study was conducted on twenty-two patients who 
      experienced poor response after bariatric surgery and followed a structured 
      VLCKD. Anthropometric parameters, body composition, muscular strength, 
      biochemical analyses, and nutritional behavior questionnaires were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: A significant weight loss (mean 14.1 ± 4.8%), mostly due to fat mass, 
      was observed during VLCKD with the preservation of muscular strength. The weight 
      loss obtained allowed patients with IWL to reach a body weight significantly 
      lower than that obtained at the post-bariatric surgery nadir and to report the 
      body weight of patients with WR at the nadir observed after surgery. The 
      significantly beneficial changes in nutritional behaviors and metabolic profiles 
      were observed without variations in kidney and liver function, vitamins, and iron 
      status. The nutritional regimen was well tolerated, and no significant side 
      effects were detected. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the efficacy, 
      feasibility, and tolerability of VLCKD in patients with poor response after 
      bariatric surgery.

TI  - Ketogenic Diet-Induced Weight Loss is Associated with an Increase in Vitamin D 
      Levels in Obese Adults.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24132499 [doi]
LID - 2499
AB  - Vitamin D is an important micronutrient involved in several processes. Evidence 
      has shown a strong association between hypovitaminosis D and cardio-metabolic 
      diseases, including obesity. A ketogenic diet has proven to be very effective for 
      weight loss, especially in reducing fat mass while preserving fat-free mass. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a ketogenic diet-induced 
      weight loss on vitamin D status in a population of obese adults. We enrolled 56 
      obese outpatients, prescribed with either traditional standard hypocaloric 
      Mediterranean diet (SHMD) or very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD). Serum 
      25(OH)D concentrations were measured by chemiluminescence. The mean value of 
      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in the whole population at 
      baseline was 17.8 ± 5.6 ng/mL, without differences between groups. After 12 
      months of dietetic treatment, in VLCKD patients serum 25(OH)D concentrations 
      increased from 18.4 ± 5.9 to 29.3 ± 6.8 ng/mL (p < 0.0001), vs 17.5 ± 6.1 to 21.3 
      ± 7.6 ng/mL (p = 0.067) in the SHMD group (for each kilogram of weight loss, 
      25(OH)D concentration increased 0.39 and 0.13 ng/mL in the VLCKD and in the SHMD 
      groups, respectively). In the VLCKD group, the increase in serum 25(OH)D 
      concentrations was strongly associated with body mass index, waist circumference, 
      and fatty mass variation. In a multiple regression analysis, fatty mass was the 
      strongest independent predictor of serum 25(OH)D concentration, explaining 15.6%, 
      3.3%, and 9.4% of its variation in the whole population, in SHMD, and VLCKD 
      groups, respectively. We also observed a greater reduction of inflammation 
      (evaluated by high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) values) and a greater 
      improvement in glucose homeostasis, confirmed by a reduction of HOMA values, in 
      the VLCKD versus the SHMD group. Taken together, all these data suggest that a 
      dietetic regimen, which implies a great reduction of fat mass, can improve 
      vitamin D status in the obese.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The loss of fat-free mass (FFM) that occurs during weight loss 
      secondary to low-calorie diet can lead to numerous and deleterious consequences. 
      We performed a review to evaluate the state of the art on metabolic and 
      nutritional correlates of loss of fat free mass during low calorie diet and 
      treatment for maintaining fat free mass. METHODS: This review included 44 
      eligible studies. There are various diet strategies to maintain FFM during a 
      low-calorie diet, including adoption of a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD) and taking an adequate amount of specific nutrients (vitamin D, leucine, 
      whey protein). RESULTS: Regarding the numerous and various low-calorie diet 
      proposals for achieving weight loss, the comparison of VLCKD with prudent 
      low-calorie diet found that FFM was practically unaffected by VLCKD. There are 
      numerous possible mechanisms for this, involving insulin and the insulin-like 
      growth factor-1-growth hormone axis, which acts by stimulating protein synthesis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Considering protein and amino acids intake, an adequate daily intake 
      of leucine (4 g/d) and whey protein (20 g/d) is recommended. Regarding vitamin D, 
      if the blood vitamin D has low values (<30 ng/mL), it is mandatory that adequate 
      supplementation is provided, specifically calcifediol, because in the obese 
      patient this form is recommended to avoid seizure in the adipose tissue; 3 to 4 
      drops/d or 20 to 30 drops/wk of calcifediol are generally adequate to restore 
      normal 25(OH)D plasma levels in obese patients.

TI  - Nutritional Intervention in Cushing's Disease: The Ketogenic Diet's Effects on 
      Metabolic Comorbidities and Adrenal Steroids.
LID - 10.3390/nu15214647 [doi]
LID - 4647
AB  - BACKGROUND: a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is associated with 
      improvement of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. We aimed to evaluate the 
      effects of a VLCKD in patients with Cushing's disease (CD) as adjunctive therapy 
      to treatment for the primary disease. METHODS: we evaluated clinical, hormonal 
      and metabolic parameters in 15 patients with CD and 15 controls at baseline after 
      1 week and 3 weeks of VLCKD and, further, after 2 weeks of a low-carbohydrate 
      ketogenic diet (LCKD). RESULTS: after 5 weeks of diet, a significant decrease in 
      BMI (p = 0.002), waist circumference (WC) (p = 0.024), systolic blood pressure (p 
      = 0.015), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.005), ACTH (p = 0.026), cortisone (p = 
      0.025), total cholesterol (p = 0.006), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.017), triglycerides 
      (p = 0.016) and alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.008) and a significant increase in 
      HDL cholesterol (p = 0.017), vitamin D (p = 0.015) and oral disposition index 
      (oDI) (p = 0.004) was observed in the CD patients. A significant decrease in BMI 
      (p = 0.003), WC (p = 0.002), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.025), diastolic (p = 
      0.007) blood pressure and total cholesterol (p = 0.026) and an increase in HDL 
      cholesterol (p = 0.001) and oDI (p < 0.001) was observed in controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: the current study confirms that a ketogenic diet is effective in 
      improving metabolic disorders in CD and shows that a nutritional approach may be 
      combined with conventional CD therapy in order to improve metabolic and 
      cardiovascular comorbidities.

TI  - Beyond weight loss in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: the role of carbohydrate 
      restriction.
PG  - 349-353
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000762 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The low fat diet (LFD) is currently the first choice to treat 
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) alongside with physical activity. 
      However, low carbohydrate diets (LCDs) and ketogenic diets have gained attention 
      lately, thanks to their favourable impact in reducing intrahepatic triglyceride 
      content. We therefore aimed at providing an update on recent evidence evaluating 
      the hepatoprotective effects of such dietary interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Novel findings confirmed previous evidence by showing beneficial effects on liver 
      fat content reduction for both LFDs and LCDs. The further restriction of 
      carbohydrates to less than 50 g/day, usually leading to ketosis, confirmed to 
      produce an improvement in NAFLD, with very low-calorie ketogenic diets possibly 
      proving particularly beneficial thanks to the significant weight loss that can be 
      obtained. SUMMARY: Most of the latest evidence shows that carbohydrate 
      restriction plays a fundamental role in the modulation of lipid metabolism 
      leading to similar efficacy in improving NAFLD compared with LFDs. The 
      hepatoprotective role of carbohydrate restriction appears to be boosted when 
      ketogenesis is induced, when the total calorie intake is extremely reduced, or, 
      possibly, when dietary interventions have reduced content in free sugars, making 
      such interventions valuable tools to deal with NAFLD.

TI  - Effects of a Personalized VLCKD on Body Composition and Resting Energy 
      Expenditure in the Reversal of Diabetes to Prevent Complications.
LID - 10.3390/nu11071526 [doi]
LID - 1526
AB  - The reversion of diabetes and the treatment of long-term obesity are difficult 
      challenges. The failure mechanisms of rapid weight loss are mainly related to the 
      wasting of lean mass. This single-arm study aims to evaluate the effects of a 
      very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) on body composition and resting energy 
      expenditure in the short term reversal of diabetes mellitus Type 2. For eight 
      weeks, subjects were administered a personalized VLCKD with protein intake based 
      on lean mass and synthetic amino acidic protein supplementation. Each subject was 
      assessed by anthropometry, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry(DXA), 
      bioimpedentiometric analysis (BIA), indirect calorimetry, and biochemical 
      analysis. The main findings were the saving of lean mass, the reduction of 
      abdominal fat mass, restored metabolic flexibility, the maintenance of resting 
      energy expenditure, and the reversion of diabetes. These results highlight how 
      the application of preventive, predictive, personalized, and participative 
      medicine to nutrition may be promising for the prevention of diabetes and 
      enhancement of obesity treatment.

TI  - Cardiovascular and hormonal aspects of very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.
PG  - 115S-23S
AB  - In recent years, restriction of carbohydrate intake for weight loss has become 
      widespread. Our research group began studying physiological responses to 
      very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) in the late 1990s because we felt 
      there was a significant void in the literature and limited understanding of 
      metabolic responses to VLCKDs. This launched us into a line of research examining 
      the physiological effects of VLCKDs. In this paper, we briefly overview nine 
      studies we have published on isoenergetic and hypoenergetic VLCKDs in men and 
      women. These studies have focused on blood lipid responses to VLCKDs, but we have 
      also addressed changes in body weight, body composition, and hormones. Compared 
      with low-fat diets, short-term VLCKDs consistently result in improvements in fat 
      loss, fasting and postprandial triacylglycerols, high-density 
      lipoprotein-cholesterol, the distribution of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol 
      subclasses, and insulin resistance. These are the key metabolic abnormalities of 
      metabolic syndrome, a problem of epidemic proportions in the United States. There 
      is substantial variability in total cholesterol and low-density 
      lipoprotein-cholesterol responses to VLCKD. The factors responsible for this 
      variability are not known, and studies designed to identify methods to predict 
      blood lipid responses to VLCKD and other dietary approaches represent critical 
      areas for nutrition researchers. Further research is warranted to validate the 
      physiological effects of VLCKD over longer periods of time, including studies 
      that modify the quality of macronutrients (i.e., the type of fat and protein) and 
      the interaction with other interventions (e.g., exercise, dietary supplements, 
      drugs).

TI  - The Antioxidant Potential of the Mediterranean Diet as a Predictor of Weight Loss 
      after a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) in Women with Overweight and 
      Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/antiox12010018 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - Obesity involves a chronic state of low-grade inflammation, which is linked to 
      the development of several comorbidities. Recently, the very low-calorie 
      ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has gained great interest in the treatment of obesity, 
      almost ousting the ancient and healthy Mediterranean diet (MD). However, because 
      these dietary regimens exploit different pathophysiological mechanisms, we 
      hypothesize that adherence to the MD may play a role in determining the efficacy 
      of the VLCKD. We enrolled 318 women (age 38.84 ± 14.37 years; BMI 35.75 ± 5.18 
      kg/m²) and assessed their anthropometric parameters, body compositions, and 
      adherence to the MD (with the PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) 
      questionnaire) at baseline. The anthropometric parameters and body composition 
      were repeated at the end of the VLCKD. At the end of the VLCKD, the women with 
      high adherence to the MD achieved the best results in terms of weight loss and 
      improved body composition. Specifically, the women who were above the median of 
      fat mass (FM)% reduction had the best MD pattern, characterized by a higher 
      consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), fruits, vegetables, and red wine, 
      as well as a higher adherence to the MD than the women who were below the same 
      median. In a multiple regression analysis, the PREDIMED score was the main 
      predictor of the FM% reduction score and came in first, followed by fruit, EVOO, 
      and glasses of wine, in predicting the percentage reduction in FM. A PREDIMED 
      score value of > 5 could serve as a threshold to identify patients who are more 
      likely to lose FM at the end of the VLCKD. In conclusion, high adherence to the 
      MD resulted in higher VLCKD efficacy. This could be due to the antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory properties of the MD, which are capable of establishing a 
      metabolic set-up that is favorable to the onset of more effective ketosis.

TI  - Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diets With Whey, Vegetable, or Animal Protein in 
      Patients With Obesity: A Randomized Pilot Study.
LID - dgaa336 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaa336 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: We compared the efficacy, safety, and effect of 45-day isocaloric 
      very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) incorporating whey, vegetable, or 
      animal protein on the microbiota in patients with obesity and insulin resistance 
      to test the hypothesis that protein source may modulate the response to VLCKD 
      interventions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with obesity (19 males 
      and 29 females, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index ≥ 2.5, aged 56.2 ± 6.1 
      years, body mass index [BMI] 35.9 ± 4.1 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to three 
      45-day isocaloric VLCKD regimens (≤800 kcal/day) containing whey, plant, or 
      animal protein. Anthropometric indexes; blood and urine chemistry, including 
      parameters of kidney, liver, glucose, and lipid metabolism; body composition; 
      muscle strength; and taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome were assessed. 
      Adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: Body weight, BMI, blood pressure, 
      waist circumference, HOMA index, insulin, and total and low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol decreased in all patients. Patients who consumed whey protein had a 
      more pronounced improvement in muscle strength. The markers of renal function 
      worsened slightly in the animal protein group. A decrease in the relative 
      abundance of Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes were observed after the 
      consumption of VLCKDs. This pattern was less pronounced in patients consuming 
      animal protein. CONCLUSIONS: VLCKDs led to significant weight loss and a striking 
      improvement in metabolic parameters over a 45-day period. VLCKDs based on whey or 
      vegetable protein have a safer profile and result in a healthier microbiota 
      composition than those containing animal proteins. VLCKDs incorporating whey 
      protein are more effective in maintaining muscle performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms underlying the potential health benefits of 
      a ketogenic diet are unknown and could be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify the changes in the obesity-related methylome that are 
      mediated by the induced weight loss or are dependent on ketosis in subjects with 
      obesity underwent a very-low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD). METHODS: Twenty-one 
      patients with obesity (n = 12 women, 47.9 ± 1.02 yr, 33.0 ± 0.2 kg/m(2)) after 6 
      months on a VLCKD and 12 normal weight volunteers (n = 6 women, 50.3 ± 6.2 yrs, 
      22.7 ± 1.5 kg/m(2)) were studied. Data from the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip 
      methylomes of blood leukocytes were obtained at time points of ketotic phases 
      (basal, maximum ketosis, and out of ketosis) during VLCKD (n = 10) and at 
      baseline in volunteers (n = 12). Results were further validated by pyrosequencing 
      in representative cohort of patients on a VLCKD (n = 18) and correlated with gene 
      expression. RESULTS: After weight reduction by VLCKD, differences were found at 
      988 CpG sites (786 unique genes). The VLCKD altered methylation levels in 
      patients with obesity had high resemblance with those from normal weight 
      volunteers and was concomitant with a downregulation of DNA methyltransferases 
      (DNMT)1, 3a and 3b. Most of the encoded genes were involved in metabolic 
      processes, protein metabolism, and muscle, organ, and skeletal system 
      development. Novel genes representing the top scoring associated events were 
      identified, including ZNF331, FGFRL1 (VLCKD-induced weight loss) and CBFA2T3, 
      C3orf38, JSRP1, and LRFN4 (VLCKD-induced ketosis). Interestingly, ZNF331 and 
      FGFRL1 were validated in an independent cohort and inversely correlated with gene 
      expression. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of VLCKD therapy on obesity 
      involve a methylome more suggestive of normal weight that could be mainly 
      mediated by the VLCKD-induced ketosis rather than weight loss.

TI  - Very low calorie ketogenic diet combined with physical interval training for 
      preserving muscle mass during weight loss in sarcopenic obesity: A pilot study.
PG  - 955024
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.955024 [doi]
LID - 955024
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity (SO) is increasing worldwide, 
      posing important challenges to public health and national health care system, 
      especially during the COVID pandemic. In subjects with SO, it is essential to 
      reduce body weight, and to preserve lean mass, to avoid worsening of muscle 
      function. Adequate nutrition and correct physical activity is essential to 
      counteract SO progression. Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD), a 
      well-established nutritional intervention for obesity, has been also indicated 
      for the treatment of SO. To date, the effects of physical training during VLCKD 
      have not been investigated. AIM: This pilot study aims to determine the efficacy 
      of VLCKD combined with interval training, compared to a VLCKD alone, on 
      weight-loss, body composition, and physical performance in participants with SO. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four participants with SO, aged between 50 and 70 
      years, who met the inclusion criteria, accepted to adhere to a VLCKD (<800 
      Kcal/die) and to give informed consent, were enrolled in the study. Twelve 
      participants followed a structured VLCKD protocol (VLCKD group) and twelve 
      followed the same VLCKD protocol combined with interval training (IT), twice per 
      week (VLCKD + IT group). Data were collected at baseline (T0) and after 6-week of 
      treatment (T6). Anthropometric indexes, body composition analysis by 
      Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), muscle strength and physical performance 
      analysis were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: At the 
      end of the study, body mass index (BMI), body weight, waist circumference, and 
      hip circumference were significantly reduced in both VLCKD group and VLCKD + IT 
      group. Interestingly, a significant improvement in muscle strength and physical 
      performance was observed in both groups. A multiple comparison of delta 
      variations in all parameters between groups was performed. No differences were 
      observed for the majority of anthropometric and biochemical parameters, with the 
      exception of fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM): notably, participants who 
      followed a VLCKD combined with IT preserved FFM (p < 0.001) and reduced FM (p = 
      0.001) to a greater extent than what observed in VLCKD group. Moreover, high 
      density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol plasma levels were significantly higher in 
      the VLCKD + IT group compared to the VLCKD group. CONCLUSION: This pilot study 
      confirms that VLCKD is effective in terms of body weight reduction, particularly 
      FM; moreover, the combination of VLCKD and interval training could determine a 
      better preservation of FFM.

PG  - 23

LID - 23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) is currently a promising 
      approach for the treatment of obesity. However, little is known about the side 
      effects since most of the studies reporting them were carried out in normal 
      weight subjects following Ketogenic Diet for other purposes than obesity. Thus, 
      the aims of the study were: (1) to investigate the safety of VLCKD in subjects 
      with obesity; (2) if VLCKD-related side effects could have an impact on its 
      efficacy. METHODS: In this prospective study we consecutively enrolled 106 
      subjects with obesity (12 males and 94 females, BMI 34.98 ± 5.43 kg/m(2)) that 
      underwent to VLCKD. In all subjects we recorded side effects at the end of 
      ketogenic phase and assessed anthropometric parameters at the baseline and at the 
      end of ketogenic phase. In a subgroup of 25 subjects, we also assessed 
      biochemical parameters. RESULTS: No serious side effects occurred in our 
      population and those that did occur were clinically mild and did not lead to 
      discontinuation of the dietary protocol as they could be easily managed by 
      healthcare professionals or often resolved spontaneously. Nine (8.5%) subjects 
      stopped VLCKD before the end of the protocol for the following reasons: 2 (1.9%) 
      due to palatability and 7 (6.1%) due to excessive costs. Finally, there were no 
      differences in terms of weight loss percentage (13.5 ± 10.9% vs 18.2 ± 8.9%; 
      p = 0.318) in subjects that developed side effects and subjects that did not 
      developed side effects. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that VLCKD is a 
      promising, safe and effective therapeutic tool for people with obesity. Despite 
      common misgivings, side effects are mild, transient and can be prevented and 
      managed by adhering to the appropriate indications and contraindications for 
      VLCKD, following well-organized and standardized protocols and performing 
      adequate clinical and laboratory monitoring.

PG  - 392-399
LID - 10.1007/s12020-020-02518-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are increasingly spread in our society. Low 
      testosterone levels are often present in these patients, the so-called metabolic 
      hypogonadism, that further alters the metabolic balance in a sort of vicious 
      cycle. Very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has been reported to efficiently 
      reduce body weight, glycaemia, and the serum levels of insulin, glycated 
      hemoglobin, but its effects on β-cell function and total testosterone (TT) levels 
      are less clear. AIM: To evaluate the effects of VLCKD on markers suggested to be 
      predictive of β-cell dysfunction development, such as proinsulin or 
      proinsulin/insulin ratio, and on TT values in a cohort of overweight or obese 
      nondiabetic male patients with metabolic hypogonadism. METHODS: Patients with 
      overweight or obesity and metabolic hypogonadism underwent to VLCKD for 12 weeks. 
      Anthropometric parameters, blood testing for the measurement of glycaemia, 
      insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, TT, calculation of body-mass index (BMI), and 
      HOMA index were performed before VLCKD and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty 
      patients (mean age 49.3 ± 5.2 years) were enrolled. At enrollement all patients 
      presented increased insulin, HOMA index, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels, 
      whereas the proinsulin/insulin ratio was within the normal values. After VLCKD 
      treatment, body weight and BMI significantly decreased, and 14.9 ± 3.9% loss of 
      the initial body weight was achieved. Glycaemia, insulin, HOMA index, C-peptide, 
      and proinsulin significantly decreased compared to pre-VLCKD levels. Serum 
      glycaemia, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels returned within the normal 
      range in all patients. No difference in the proinsulin/insulin ratio was observed 
      after VLCKD treatment. A mean increase of 218.1 ± 53.9% in serum TT levels was 
      achieved and none of the patients showed TT values falling in the hypogonadal 
      range at the end of the VLCKD treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study 
      that evaluated the effects of VLCKD on proinsulin, proinsulin/insulin ratio, and 
      TT levels. VLCKD could be safely used to improve β-cell secretory function and 
      insulin-sensitivity, and to rescue overweight and obese patients from β-cell 
      failure and metabolic hypogonadism.

TI  - Heart Rate Variability and Sympathetic Activity Is Modulated by Very Low-Calorie 
      Ketogenic Diet.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19042253 [doi]
LID - 2253
AB  - Obesity is characterized by an energy imbalance and by the accumulation of 
      visceral adipose tissue. The energy balance is controlled by a complex set of 
      balanced physiological systems that provide hunger and satiety signals to the 
      brain and regulate the body's ability to consume energy. The central nervous 
      system controls the metabolic state, influencing the activity of other systems 
      and receiving information from them. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the natural 
      variability of the heart rate in response to several factors. HRV is related to 
      the interaction between the SNS and the parasympathetic. In the light of this 
      evidence, the aim of this study is to investigate the possible effects of the two 
      different dietary regimens such as very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) vs. 
      low caloric diet (LCD), on the functions of the nervous system, with particular 
      attention to the autonomous control of heart rate variability (HRV). A total of 
      26 obese subjects underwent diet therapy in order to reduce body weight; they 
      were also randomly divided into two groups: the VLCKD group and the LCD group. 
      Our results showed that in both groups, there is a reduction in heart rate as an 
      indicator of sympathetic activity; we found a statistically significant variation 
      only in the VLCKD group. Therefore, this study supports the notion that the 
      sympathovagal balance can be modulated by a specific diet, but further studies 
      are needed to clarify the molecular pathway undergoing this modulation.

TI  - From the Ketogenic Diet to the Mediterranean Diet: The Potential Dietary Therapy 
      in Patients with Obesity after CoVID-19 Infection (Post CoVID Syndrome).
PG  - 144-165
LID - 10.1007/s13679-022-00475-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review primarily examines the evidence for areas of 
      consensus and on-going uncertainty or controversy about diet and physical 
      exercise approaches for in the post-CoVID. We propose an ideal dietary and 
      physical activity approach that the patient with obesity should follow after 
      CoVID-19 infection in order to reduce the clinical conditions associated with 
      post-CoVID syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: The CoVID-19 disease pandemic, caused by 
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, has spread all over the 
      globe, infecting hundreds of millions of individuals and causing millions of 
      death. It is also known to be is associated with several medical and 
      psychological complications, especially in patients with obesity and 
      weight-related disorders who in general pose a significant global public health 
      problem, and in specific affected individuals are on a greater risk of developing 
      poorer CoVID-19 clinical outcomes and experience a higher rate of mortality. 
      Little is still known about the best nutritional approach to be adopted in this 
      disease especially in the patients post-CoVID syndrome. To the best of our 
      knowledge, no specific nutritional recommendations exist to manage in the 
      patients post-CoVID syndrome. We report a presentation of nutritional therapeutic 
      approach based on a ketogenic diet protocol followed by a transition to the 
      Mediterranean diet in patients post-infection by CoVID, combined to a physical 
      activity program to address conditions associated with post-CoVID syndrome.

AB  - Several studies have described a strong correlation between diet, weight loss, 
      and gut microbiota composition. The aim of this review was to evaluate the 
      potential effects of energy-restricted diets, namely very low calorie diets 
      (VLCDs), very low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs), and very low carbohydrate 
      diets (VLCarbDs), on the composition of the gut microbiota in humans. We 
      performed a literature search using the following terms (with their abbreviations 
      or acronyms): "very low calorie diet", "very low calorie ketogenic diet", "very 
      low carbohydrate diet", and "gut microbiota". Our search strategy retrieved nine 
      eligible studies. Overall, VLCDs and VLCarbDs affected the Bacteroidetes to 
      Firmicutes ratio in obese patients, leading to a reduction in short-chain fatty 
      acid production by fecal microbiota associated with Clostridial cluster XIVa. 
      This reduction particularly affected Roseburia and Eubacterium rectale, the two 
      most abundant butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces. VLCKDs preserved the 
      core fecal microbiome, but altered the composition of fecal microbial populations 
      in relation to the plasma metabolome and fecal bile acid composition. In 
      particular, VLCKD-induced weight loss resulted in a reduction in E. rectale and 
      Roseburia, an increase in Christensenellaceae and Akkermansia while not all 
      studies show a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Although very few 
      studies have analyzed the effects of VLCarbDs and VLCDs on gut microbiota, 
      significant diet-induced changes in fecal microbiota composition have been 
      observed. Further studies are needed.

AB  - Weight loss after bariatric surgery decreases the earlier expansion of the 
      adventitial vasa vasorum (VV), a biomarker of early atheromatous disease. 
      However, no data are available regarding weight loss achieved by very low calorie 
      ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on VV and lipid-based atherogenic indices. A randomized 
      clinical trial was performed to examine changes in adventitial VV density in 20 
      patients with moderate obesity who underwent a 6-month very low calorie ketogenic 
      diet (VLCKD, 600-800 kcal/day), and 10 participants with hypocaloric diet based 
      on the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet, estimated reduction of 500 kcal on the usual 
      intake). Contrast-enhanced carotid ultrasound was used to assess the VV. Body 
      composition analysis was also used. The atherogenic index of plasma (log 
      (triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio)) and the 
      triglyceride-glucose index were calculated. Serum concentrations of soluble 
      intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), and soluble vascular cell adhesion 
      molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) were measured. The impact of weight on quality of life-lite 
      (IWQOL-Lite) questionnaire was administered. Participants of intervention groups 
      displayed a similar VV values. Significant improvements of BMI (-5.3 [-6.9 to 
      -3.6] kg/m(2), p < 0.001), total body fat (-7.0 [-10.7 to -3.3] %, p = 0.003), 
      and IWQOL-Lite score (-41.4 [-75.2 to -7.6], p = 0.027) were observed in VLCKD 
      group in comparison with MedDiet group. Although after a 6-months follow-up 
      period VV density (mean, right and left sides) did not change significantly in 
      any group, participants in the VLCKD exhibited a significantly decrease both in 
      their atherogenic index of plasma and serum concentration of sICAM-1. A 6-month 
      intervention with VLCKD do not impact in the density of the adventitial VV in 
      subjects with moderate obesity, but induces significant changes in markers of 
      endothelial dysfunction and CV risk.

TI  - Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet: A Potential Treatment for Binge Eating and Food 
      Addiction Symptoms in Women. A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182312802 [doi]
LID - 12802
AB  - BACKGROUND: many patients who struggle to lose weight are unable to cut down 
      certain ultra-processed, refined types of food with a high glycemic index. This 
      condition is linked to responses similar to addiction that lead to overeating. A 
      very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) with adequate protein intake could be 
      considered a valid dietary approach. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 
      the feasibility of a VLCKD in women with binge eating and/or food addiction 
      symptoms. METHODS: subjects diagnosed with binge eating and/or food addiction 
      symptoms (measured with the Binge Eating Scale and the Yale Food Addiction Scale 
      2.0) were asked to follow a VLCKD with protein replacement for 5-7 weeks (T1) and 
      a low-calorie diet for 11-21 weeks (T2). Self-reported food addiction and binge 
      eating symptoms and body composition were tested at T0 (baseline) and at the end 
      of each diet (T1 and T2 respectively); Results: five women were included in the 
      study. Mean age was 36.4 years (SEM = 4.95) and mean BMI was 31.16 (SEM = 0.91). 
      At T0, two cases of severe food addiction, one case of mild food addiction, one 
      case of binge eating with severe food addiction, and one case of binge eating 
      were recorded. Weight loss was recorded at both T1 and T2 (ranging from 4.8% to 
      11.6% of the initial body weight at T1 and from 7.3% to 12.8% at T2). No case of 
      food addiction and/or binge eating symptoms was recorded at T2. Muscle mass was 
      preserved. CONCLUSIONS: recent findings have highlighted the potential 
      therapeutic role of ketogenic diets for the treatment of addiction to 
      high-calorie, ultra-processed and high-glycemic food. Our pilot study 
      demonstrates the feasibility of a ketogenic diet in women with addictive-like 
      eating disorders seeking to lose weight.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posing a serious challenge to the 
      health-care systems worldwide, with an enormous impact on health conditions and 
      loss of lives. Notably, obesity and its related comorbidities are strictly 
      related with worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 disease. Recently, there is a 
      growing interest in the clinical use of ketogenic diets (KDs), particularly in 
      the context of severe obesity with related metabolic complications. KDs have been 
      proven effective for a rapid reduction of fat mass, preserving lean mass and 
      providing an adequate nutritional status. In particular, the physiological 
      increase in plasma levels of ketone bodies exerts important anti-inflammatory and 
      immunomodulating effects, which may reveal as precious tools to prevent infection 
      and potential adverse outcomes of COVID-19 disease. We discuss here the 
      importance of KDs for a rapid reduction of several critical risk factors for 
      COVID-19, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension, based on the known 
      effects of ketone bodies on inflammation, immunity, metabolic profile and 
      cardiovascular function. We do believe that a rapid reduction of all modifiable 
      risk factors, especially obesity with its metabolic complications, should be a 
      pillar of public health policies and interventions, in view of future waves of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      metabolism and cardiometabolic risk factors: a narrative review.
PG  - 318-333
LID - 10.23736/S2724-6507.22.03922-7 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide obesity and cardiovascular diseases have encouraged the adoption of new 
      and efficient dietary strategies. Among various proposed diets, ketogenic diets, 
      both the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and the low-calorie ketogenic 
      diet (LCKD), have been suggested in recent years as an effective nutritional 
      approach for obesity management. The VLCKD and the LCKD are characterized by a 
      low carbohydrate content (<50 g/day), 1-1.5 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight, 
      less than 20-30 g of lipids, and a daily intake of about 800 calories for VLCKD 
      and about 1200-1400 calories for LCKD. The purpose of our narrative review is to 
      offer an overview of the most impactful studies in the scientific literature 
      regarding VLCKD and LCKD to discuss their short- and long-term effects (less than 
      12 months and more than 12 months respectively) on weight loss, metabolic and 
      cardiovascular aspects. Articles we focused on were cohort studies, case-control 
      studies, cross-sectional studies, randomized controlled trials, and 
      meta-analyses. Results indicate that VLCKD and LCKD could be helpful to 
      ameliorate metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors such as weight loss, 
      glucose, and cholesterol levels, both in the short and long term. Further 
      research in this area may include more randomized controlled trials to gather 
      more data.

TI  - Ketogenic Diet for Obese COVID-19 Patients: Is Respiratory Disease a 
      Contraindication? A Narrative Review of the Literature on Ketogenic Diet and 
      Respiratory Function.

AB  - Morbid obese people are more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection and its most 
      severe complications, as need for mechanical ventilation. Ketogenic Diet (KD) is 
      able to induce a fast weight loss preserving lean mass and is particularly 
      interesting as a preventive measure in obese patients. Moreover, KD has 
      anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties, which may help in preventing 
      the cytokine storm in infected patients. Respiratory failure is actually 
      considered a contraindication for VLCKD, a very-low calorie form of KD, but in 
      the literature there are some data reporting beneficial effects on respiratory 
      parameters from ketogenic and low-carbohydrate high-fat diets. KD may be helpful 
      in reducing ventilatory requirements in respiratory patients, so it should be 
      considered in specifically addressed clinical trials as an adjuvant therapy for 
      obese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet on Testicular Function in 
      Overweight/Obese Men.
LID - 10.3390/nu12102967 [doi]
LID - 2967
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has become an increasingly worrisome reality. A 
      very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) represents a promising option by which to 
      achieve significant weight loss. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness 
      of VLCKD on metabolic parameters and hormonal profiles of obese male patients. 
      METHODS: We enrolled 40 overweight/obese men who consumed VLCKD for at least 
      eight weeks. Body weight, waist circumference, fasting glucose, insulin, total 
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, creatinine, uric acid, 
      aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, vitamin D, luteinizing 
      hormone (LH), total testosterone (TT), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were 
      calculated before and after VLCKD consumption. We additionally determined the 
      homeostasis model assessment index and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) values. 
      RESULTS: After VLCKD (13.5 ± 0.83 weeks), the mean body weight loss was 21.05 ± 
      1.44 kg; the glucose homeostasis and lipid profile were improved significantly; 
      serum vitamin D, LH, and TT levels were increased and the PSA levels were 
      decreased significantly as compared with pretreatment values. These results are 
      of interest since obesity can lead to hypogonadism and in turn, testosterone 
      deficiency is associated with impaired glucose homeostasis, metabolic syndrome, 
      and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, a close relationship between obesity, insulin 
      resistance, and/or hyperinsulinemia and increased prostate volume has been 
      reported, with a consequent greater risk of developing lower urinary tract 
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: VLCKD is an effective tool against obesity and could be a 
      noninvasive, rapid, and valid means to treat obese patients with metabolic 
      hypogonadism and lower urinary tract symptoms.

TI  - Very low calorie ketogenic diet and common rheumatic disorders: A case report.
PG  - 1985-1991
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v11.i9.1985 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The scientific literature provides evidence that nutritional ketosis 
      can be an important support in the treatment of pathologies in which inflammation 
      is present, as recent studies have shown that ketone bodies have 
      anti-inflammatory activity in numerous diseases, including rheumatic diseases. We 
      report the case of a 22-year-old woman with class I obesity and juvenile 
      idiopathic arthritis who started treatment with a very low calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD). CASE SUMMARY: The patient was a 22-year-old woman diagnosed with 
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis at age 4 years and with a body mass index (BMI) of 
      30.8 kg/m(2), waist circumference (WC) 80 cm, fat mass (FM) 28.1 kg, free FM 45.7 
      kg, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) 3.5 kg, assessed on bioimpedance analysis. 
      She was treated using a commercial VLCKD weight-loss program (PNK(®) method); 
      this program provides high-biological-value protein preparations and natural 
      foods. Each protein preparation contains 15 g protein, 4 g carbohydrate, 3 g fat, 
      and 50 mg omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid, with an energy content of 90-120 kcal. 
      After four months on the program, the BMI was 28.6 kg/m(2), WC 73 cm, FM 23.2 kg, 
      free FM 41.9 kg, and VAT 2.9 kg. CONCLUSION: VLCKD enabled the patient to reach 
      her target weight and to reduce her joint pain and headaches. Laboratory 
      inflammatory indices also normalized.

TI  - Ketogenic state improves testosterone serum levels-results from a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 273-282
LID - 10.1007/s12020-022-03195-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely demonstrated that obesity and hypogonadism are 
      bi-directionally correlated, since the hypogonadism prevalence is higher in obese 
      population, while weight loss increases testosterone serum levels. Several 
      approaches are available to contrast weight excess, from simple dietary regimens 
      to more complex surgical procedures. Ketogenic diets (KD) fit in this context and 
      their application is growing year after year, aiming to improve the metabolic and 
      weight patterns in obese patients. However, KD influence on testosterone levels 
      is still poorly investigated. OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the 
      potential effect of KD on testosterone levels. METHODS: A systematic literature 
      search was performed until April 2022 including studies investigating 
      testosterone levels before and after KD. Secondary endpoints were body weight, 
      estradiol and sex-hormone binding globulin serum levels. Any kind of KD was 
      considered eligible, and no specific criteria for study populations were 
      provided. RESULTS: Seven studies (including eight trials) were included in the 
      analysis for a total of 230 patients, five using normocaloric KD and three very 
      low calories KD (VLCKD). Only three studies enrolled overweight/obese men. A 
      significant total testosterone increase was recorded after any kind of KD 
      considering 111 patients (2.86 [0.95, 4.77], p = 0.003). This increase was more 
      evident considering VLCKD compared to normocaloric KD (6.75 [3.31, 10.20], 
      p < 0.001, versus 0.98 [0.08, 1.88], p = 0.030). Meta-regression analyses 
      highlighted significant correlations between the post-KD testosterone raise with 
      patients' age (R-squared 36.4, p < 0.001) and weight loss (R-squared 73.6, 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensively, KD improved testosterone levels 
      depending on both patients' age and KD-induced weight loss. However, the lack of 
      information in included studies on hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
      axis prevents an exhaustive comprehension about mechanisms connecting ketosis and 
      testosterone homeostasis.

AB  - Several studies have shown a strong correlation between the different types of 
      diets and gut microbiota composition on glycemia and weight loss. In this 
      direction, low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets have gained popularity, despite 
      studies published so far leading to controversial results on subjects with 
      diabetes. In this narrative review, firstly, we aimed to analyze the role of 
      very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity 
      management. Secondly, in this context, we focused attention on gut microbiota as 
      a function of VLCKD, particularly in T2DM and obesity treatment. Finally, we 
      reported all this evidence to underline the importance of gut microbiota to exalt 
      new nutritional strategies for "tailor-made" management, treatment, and 
      rehabilitation in subjects with T2DM and obesity, even with diabetic 
      complications. In conclusion, this narrative review outlined the beneficial 
      impact of VLCKD on gut microbiota even in subjects with T2DM and obesity, and, 
      despite inner VLCKD short-duration feature allowing no sound-enough provisions 
      for long-term outcomes, witnessed in favor of the short-term safety of VLCKD in 
      those patients.Level of evidence Level V: Opinions of authorities, based on 
      descriptive studies, narrative reviews, clinical experience, or reports of expert 
      committees.

TI  - Different Weight Loss Intervention Approaches Reveal a Lack of a Common Pattern 
      of Gut Microbiota Changes.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11020109 [doi]
LID - 109
AB  - Options for treatment of obesity include dietary approaches and bariatric 
      surgery. Previous studies have shown that weight loss interventions have an 
      impact on gut microbiota. However, a pattern of gut microbiota changes associated 
      with weight loss independently of the type of intervention has not been described 
      yet. This study includes 61 individuals who followed different weight loss 
      strategies in three different trials: 21 followed a hypocaloric Mediterranean 
      diet (MedDiet), 18 followed a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and 22 
      patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy bariatric surgery (BS). Gut microbiota 
      profile was assessed by next-generation sequencing. A common taxon that had 
      significantly changed within the three weight loss interventions could not be 
      find. At the family level, Clostiridiaceae significantly increased its abundance 
      with MedDiet and VLCKD, whilst Porphyromonadacean and Rikenellaceae significantly 
      increased with VLCKD and BS. At genus level, in VLCKD and BS, Parabacteroides and 
      Alistipes significantly increased their abundance whilst Lactobacillus decreased. 
      At the species level, BS and VLCKD produced an increase in 
      Parabacteroidesdistasonis and a decrease in Eubactieriumventriosum and 
      Lactobacillusrogosae, whilst Orodibactersplanchnicus increased its abundance 
      after the BS and MedDiet. Predicted metagenome analysis suggested that most of 
      the changes after VLCKD were focused on pathways related to biosynthesis and 
      degradation/utilization/assimilation, while BS seems to decrease most of the 
      biosynthesis pathways. MedDiet was enriched in several pathways related to 
      fermentation to short-chain fatty acids. Our results show that weight loss is not 
      associated with a specific pattern of gut microbiota changes independently of the 
      strategy used. Indeed, gut microbiota changes according to type of weight loss 
      intervention.

TI  - The Therapeutic Role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids Mediated Very Low-Calorie 
      Ketogenic Diet-Gut Microbiota Relationships in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel 
      Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/nu14194113 [doi]
LID - 4113
AB  - The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has been recognized as a promising 
      dietary regimen for the treatment of several diseases. Short-chain fatty acids 
      (SCFAs) produced by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of indigestible dietary 
      fibre in the gut have potential value for their underlying epigenetic role in the 
      treatment of obesity and asthma-related inflammation through mediating the 
      relationships between VLCKD and the infant gut microbiota. However, it is still 
      unclear how VLCKD might influence gut microbiota composition in children, and how 
      SCFAs could play a role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To 
      overcome this knowledge gap, this review aims to investigate the role of SCFAs as 
      key epigenetic metabolites that mediate VLCKD-gut microbiota relationships in 
      children, and their therapeutic potential in IBD.

TI  - Adipose tissue and blood leukocytes ACE2 DNA methylation in obesity and after 
      weight loss.
PG  - e13685
LID - 10.1111/eci.13685 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity was consistently associated with a poor prognosis in patients 
      with COVID-19. Epigenetic mechanisms were proposed as the link between obesity 
      and comorbidities risk. AIM: To evaluate the methylation levels of 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, the main entry receptor of 
      SARS-CoV-2, in different depots of adipose tissue (AT) and leukocytes (PBMCs) in 
      obesity and after weight loss therapy based on a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD), a balanced hypocaloric diet (HCD) or bariatric surgery (BS). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: DNA methylation levels of ACE2 were extracted from our data sets 
      generated by the hybridization of subcutaneous (SAT) (n = 32) or visceral (VAT; 
      n = 32) adipose tissue, and PBMCs (n = 34) samples in Infinium 
      HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Data were compared based on the degree of obesity 
      and after 4-6 months of weight loss either by following a nutritional or surgical 
      treatment and correlated with ACE2 transcript levels. RESULTS: As compared with 
      normal weight, VAT from patients with obesity showed higher ACE2 methylation 
      levels. These differences were mirrored in PBMCs but not in SAT. The observed 
      obesity-associated methylation of ACE2 was reversed after VLCKD and HCD but not 
      after BS. Among the studied CpG sites, cg16734967 and cg21598868, located at the 
      promoter, were the most affected and correlated with BMI. The observed DNA 
      methylation pattern was inversely correlated with ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION: 
      Obesity-related VAT shows hypermethylation and downregulation of the ACE2 gene 
      that is mirrored in PBMCs and is restored after nutritional weight reduction 
      therapy. The results warrant the necessity to further evaluate its implication 
      for COVID-19 pathogenesis.

TI  - A very-low-calorie ketogenic diet normalises obesity-related enhanced levels of 
      erythropoietin compared with a low-calorie diet or bariatric surgery.
PG  - 2701-2713
LID - 10.1007/s40618-024-02364-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nutritional ketosis synergistically with body-weight loss induced by a 
      very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has proven to be effective in improving 
      obesity-related pathophysiology. Recently, growing attention has been focused on 
      the relation between erythropoietin (EPO) and obesity. Thus, this study aims to 
      investigate whether nutritional ketosis and weight loss induced by a VLCKD modify 
      the circulating levels of EPO in patients with obesity in comparison with the 
      effect of low-calorie diet (LCD) or bariatric surgery (BS). METHODS: EPO levels, 
      iron status and body composition parameters were evaluated in 72 patients with 
      overweight or obesity and 27 normal-weight subjects at baseline and after the 
      three different weight-reduction therapies (VLCKD, LCD and BS) in 69 patients 
      with excess body weight. β-hydroxybutyrate levels were also measured in the VLCKD 
      group. The follow-up was established at 2-3 months and 4-6 months. RESULTS: It 
      was found that EPO levels were higher in morbid obesity and correlated with 
      higher basal weight, fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) in the overall sample. 
      High baseline EPO levels were also correlated with higher impact on the course of 
      weight loss and changes in FM and FFM induced by the three weight-loss 
      interventions. Furthermore, the VLCKD induced a decrease in EPO levels coinciding 
      with maximum ketosis, which was maintained over time, while statistically 
      significant changes were not observed after LCD and BS. CONCLUSION: The 
      obesity-related increased EPO levels are restored after VLCKD intervention at the 
      time of maximum ketosis, suggesting a potential role of the nutritional ketosis 
      induced by the VLCKD. Baseline EPO levels could be a biomarker of response to a 
      weight-loss therapy.

TI  - Effect of Synbiotic Supplementation in a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on 
      Weight Loss Achievement and Gut Microbiota: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.
PG  - e1900167
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201900167 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Little is known about the changes that a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD) produces in gut microbiota or the effect of synbiotics during the diet. 
      The aim of this study is to evaluate changes in gut microbiota produced by a 
      VLCKD and synbiotic supplementation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized, 
      single-blind, parallel-design trial is conducted in 33 obese patients who follow 
      a weight-loss program (PnK-Method) that include a VLCKD followed by a low-calorie 
      diet (LCD). Subjects are randomly allocated to three groups: one supplemented 
      with synbiotics, a second group supplemented with a placebo during the VLCKD and 
      synbiotics during the LCD phase, and a control group given a placebo. Although 
      symbiotic administration do not produce an effect on microbial diversity, an 
      increase in short-chain fatty aciding producing bacteria and anti-inflammatory 
      mediator signals such as Odoribacter and Lachnospira is shown. The administration 
      of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and prebiotics fiber during the LCD is 
      significantly associated with the percentage of weight loss and change in 
      glucose, C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. CONCLUSIONS: 
      VLCKD produces important changes in gut microbiota. The administration of 
      synbiotics during VLCKD can improve weight loss through the amelioration of 
      inflammation, which may be mediated by the gut microbiota.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To verify safety respect to weight loss, cardiometabolic diseases of 
      short-term Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs, <800 kcal day-1). PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Randomized cross-over trial with placebo. The study had no. 2 
      dietary treatment (DT), conducted in two arms: (1) VLCKD1 in which 50% of protein 
      intake is replaced with synthetic amino acids; (2) VLCKD2 with placebo. The 
      VLCKDs (<800 kcal day-1) were different in term of protein content and quality 
      each arm lasted three weeks (wks). Between the two arms a 3-wks washout period 
      was performed to avoid additive effects on DT to follow. At the baseline, at 
      start and end of each arm, all the subjects were evaluated for their health and 
      nutritional status, by anthropometric analysis, body composition (Dual X-ray 
      Absorptiometry (DXA), Bioimpedentiometry, biochemical evaluation, and Peroxisome 
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ (PPAR) γ expression by transcriptomic analysis. 
      RESULTS: After VLCKD1 were reduced: Body Mass Index (BMI) (Δ%=-11.1%, p=0.00), 
      Total Body Water (TBW) (p<0.05); Android Fat Percentage (AFP) (Δ%=-1.8%, p=0.02); 
      Android Fat Mass (AFM) (Δ%=-12.7%, p=0.00); Gynoid Fat Mass (GFM) (Δ%=-6.3%, 
      p=0.01); Intermuscular Adipose Tissue (IMAT) (Δ%= -11.1%, p=0.00); Homeostasis 
      Model Assessment of Insulin Re-sistance (HOMA-IR) (Δ%=-62.1%, p=0.01). After 
      VLCKD1 a significant increase of uricemia, cre-atinine and aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) (respectively Δ%=35%, p=0.01; Δ%=5.9%, p=0.02; Δ%=25.5%, 
      p=0.03). After VLCKD2 were reduced: BMI (Δ%=-11.2%, p=0.00); AFM (Δ%=-14.3%, 
      p=0.00); GFM (Δ%=-6.3%, p=0.00); Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (ASMMI) 
      (Δ%=-17.5%, p=0.00); HOMA-IR (Δ%=-59,4%, p=0.02). After VLCKD2, uricemia 
      (Δ%=63.1%, p=0.03), and Vitamin D levels (Δ%=25.7%, p=0.02) were increased. No 
      significant changes of car-diovascular disease (CVD) indexes were observed after 
      DTs. No significant changes of PPARγ lev-el in any DTs. CONCLUSIONS: 21-days 
      VLCKDs not impair nutritional state; not cause negative changes in global 
      measurements of nutritional state including sarcopenia, bone mineral content, 
      hepatic, renal and lipid profile.

TI  - Supplementation with medium-chain fatty acids increases body weight loss during 
      very low-calorie ketogenic diet: a retrospective analysis in a real-life setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has shown to significantly 
      reduce body weight and fat mass, as well as inflammation. These effects are 
      supported by nutritional ketosis, which triggers the utilization of the ketone 
      body as an energy source. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCTs) might serve as 
      potential enhancers of ketone bodies production with a greater effect on weight 
      loss. Nevertheless, no clinical studies have evaluated the effect of MCTs 
      supplementation in addition to VLCKD. Therefore, the present study aimed to 
      evaluate whether the supplementation with MCTs can induce a greater weight 
      reduction during the ketogenic phase of VLCKD. METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, 263 women with overweight/obesity (body mass index, BMI: 
      35.7 ± 5.3 kg/m(2)) aged 37.5 ± 14.2 years followed one of these dietary 
      protocols for 45 days: (a) Control group, 83 participants (31.6%) (VLCKD without 
      MCTs), (b) VLCKD + MCTs group, 86 participants (32.7%) (MCTs supplementation 
      - 20 g/day- during VLCKD starting from the first day of the active phase), (c) 
      VLCKD + earlyMCTs, 94 participants (35.7%) (MCTs supplementation 
      - 20 g/day-starting from 5 days before the beginning of the VLCKD active phase. 
      Anthropometric measures, body composition, and c-reactive protein (CRP) 
      concentrations were collected at the beginning and at the end (45 days) of the 
      VLCKD intervention. RESULTS: MCTs supplementation significantly decreased body 
      weight, BMI, and waist circumference as compared to the control group, with a 
      greater effect in the VLCKD + earlyMCTs group. A two-fold decrease in fat mass 
      and an increase in muscle mass were observed in the VLCKD + earlyMCTs group as 
      compared to the control group. As for inflammation, hs-CRP concentrations 
      (assessed as absolute percent change) were significantly lower in the 
      VLCKD + MCTs group (p = 0.009) and the VLCKD + earlyMCTs group (p = 0.011) than 
      in the control group. A logistic regression model showed that VLCKD + earlyMCTs 
      increase the likelihood of improvement of BMI classes (OR: 1.85, 95% CI 
      1.02-3.36) also after adjusting for the potential confounding factors. 
      CONCLUSION: MCTs supplementation (20 g/day) may be a useful tool to enhance the 
      beneficial effect of VLCKD on the reduction of body weight and fat mass. In 
      particular, MCTs supplementation before the beginning of the VLCKD active phase 
      might facilitate ketosis thus contributing to the effectiveness of the 
      nutritional intervention.

TI  - The Effects of a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on the Intestinal Barrier 
      Integrity and Function in Patients with Obesity: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu15112561 [doi]
LID - 2561
AB  - The very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is effective and safe for obese 
      individuals, but limited information exists on its impact on the intestinal 
      barrier. This study analyzed the effects of 8 weeks of VLCKD on 24 obese patients 
      (11M/13F). Carbohydrate intake was fixed at 20-50 g/day, while protein and lipid 
      intake varied from 1-1.4 g/kg of ideal body weight and 15-30 g per day, 
      respectively. Daily calorie intake was below 800 kcal. The lactulose-mannitol 
      absorption test assessed small intestinal permeability. Multiple markers, such as 
      serum and fecal zonulin, fatty acid-binding protein, diamine oxidase 
      concentrations, urinary dysbiosis markers (indican and skatole), and circulating 
      lipopolysaccharide levels, were analyzed. Inflammation markers (serum interleukin 
      6, 8, 10, and tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations) were also evaluated. The 
      results showed significant reductions in weight, BMI, and waist circumference 
      post-diet. However, the lactulose-mannitol ratio increased by 76.5%, and a 
      significant increase in dysbiosis markers at the end of the diet occurred. This 
      trend was particularly evident in a subgroup of patients. Despite initial 
      benefits, the VLCKD might negatively affect the intestinal barrier function in 
      obese patients, potentially worsening their compromised intestinal balance.

TI  - Effects of calorie restriction and weight loss on glucose and insulin levels in 
      obese humans.
PG  - 411-9
AB  - The relative contributions of weight loss vs calorie restriction in the 
      improvement of glucose tolerance in obese subjects has not been well studied. We 
      measured fasting and stimulated glucose and insulin levels in seven obese 
      subjects at 4 time periods: on a regular diet before weight loss, on a very low 
      calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) after 4 days and after 6 weeks, and after 4 days 
      back on a regular diet. Fasting glucose and insulin levels fell significantly 
      after only 4 days of calorie restriction and did not change after 6 weeks. With 
      return to a regular diet, these levels rose toward baseline even through body 
      weight remained well below baseline. Stimulated glucose and insulin levels during 
      an insulin tolerance test, intravenous glucose tolerance test, and standard meal 
      demonstrated a similar pattern, although the changes due to either diet or weight 
      loss were minimal. We conclude that calorie restriction has a greater effect on 
      glucose and insulin levels than does weight loss in obese subjects who are losing 
      weight.

TI  - Reduction of Cardio-Metabolic Risk and Body Weight through a Multiphasic Very-Low 
      Calorie Ketogenic Diet Program in Women with Overweight/Obesity: A Study in a 
      Real-World Setting.
LID - 10.3390/nu13061804 [doi]
LID - 1804
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevention and treatment of obesity and its cardio-metabolic 
      complications are relevant issues worldwide. Among lifestyle approaches, very 
      low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) have been shown to lead to rapid initial 
      weight loss, resulting in better long-term weight loss maintenance. As no 
      information on VLCKD studies carried on in a real-world setting are available, we 
      conducted this multi-centre study in a real-world setting, aiming at assessing 
      the efficacy and the safety of a specific multiphasic VLCKD program in women with 
      overweight or obesity. METHODS: A multi-center, prospective, uncontrolled trial 
      was conducted in 33 outpatient women (age range 27-60 y) with overweight or 
      obesity (BMI: 30.9 ± 2.7 kg/m(2); waist circumference: 96.0 ± 9.4 cm) who started 
      a VLCKD dietary program (duration: 24 weeks), divided into four phases. The 
      efficacy of VLCKD was assessed by evaluating anthropometric measures and 
      cardiometabolic markers; liver and kidney function biomarkers were assessed as 
      safety parameters. RESULTS: The VLCKD program resulted in a significant decrease 
      of body weight and BMI (-14.6%) and waist circumference (-12.4%). At the end of 
      the protocol, 33.3% of the participants reached a normal weight and the subjects 
      in the obesity range were reduced from 70% to 16.7%. HOMA-IR was markedly reduced 
      from 3.17 ± 2.67 to 1.73 ± 1.23 already after phase 2 and was unchanged 
      thereafter. Systolic blood pressure decreased after phase 1 (-3.5 mmHg) and 
      remained unchanged until the end of the program. Total and LDL cholesterol and 
      triglycerides were significantly reduced by VLCKD along with a significant HDL 
      cholesterol increase. Liver, kidney and thyroid function markers did not change 
      and remained within the reference range. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of a 
      multi-center VLCKD program conducted in a real-world setting in a cohort of 
      overweight/obese women indicate that it is safe and effective, as it results in a 
      major improvement of cardiometabolic parameters, thus leading to benefits that 
      span well beyond the mere body weight/adiposity reduction.

      Reports over the Past Decade.

AB  - The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used since the 1920s as a therapy for 
      drug-resistant epilepsy. Due to the beneficial effects of this diet on the 
      nervous system and the proposed multifaceted effects of ketones on health and 
      disease, researchers have evaluated its use in other nonneurological conditions. 
      The objective of this review was to analyze the most recent papers, which is why 
      meta-analyses were used in which 75% of the studies were from 2012 to 2022. 
      Authors also cited single studies from the last decade that lasted longer than 12 
      months to assess the long-term benefits of KD. Reports from the past decade have 
      highlighted several significant areas regarding the impact of KD. One of these is 
      the use of very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) as an effective possibly safe 
      and patient-motivating component of a long-term weight loss plan. Reports on the 
      positive influence of KD on the health of obese individuals, and the possible 
      resulting validity of its use, should be verified by patients' physical activity 
      levels. A significant number of studies from the last decade evaluate the effect 
      of KD on improving the health of individuals with type 2 diabetes as an effective 
      tool in lowering glycated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac) and required doses of hypoglycemic 
      drugs. The long-term studies indicate a possible beneficial effect of KD on 
      cardiovascular function due to improvement lipid profile, changes in 
      apolipoprotein (Apo) A1, adiponectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
      (ICAM-1).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated significant advantages from a 
      preoperative dietetic regimen for candidates to bariatric procedure. OBJECTIVES: 
      Evaluation of safety, efficacy, and acceptability of a very low-calorie ketogenic 
      diet in patients before bariatric surgery. SETTING: University Hospital. METHODS: 
      A standardized 30-day sequential preoperative diet regimen has been analyzed, 
      optimizing metabolic response with gradual carbohydrate reintroduction. Patients 
      were given a dedicated KetoStationkit, for use during the first 10 days of the 
      scheme, followed by a hypocaloric scheme for 20 days. The study group underwent 
      routine laboratory tests and anthropometric measurements (percent weight loss, 
      body mass index, waist circumference) at enrollment (T0), after 10 days (T1), and 
      after 30 days (T2). Ketone body levels were measured in the plasma and urine. 
      RESULTS: Between January 2015 and September 2015, 119 patients were included in 
      the study. Mean body mass index was 41.5 ± 7.6 kg/m(2). Weight, body mass index, 
      and waist circumference at T0 and T1, T0 and T2, and T1 and T2 decreased 
      significantly (P<.05). A bioelectrical impedance assay determined a significant 
      reduction in visceral fat at T1 and T2. We observed a significant (P<.05) 
      improvement in several clinical parameters, including glycemic and lipid profile 
      parameters. We also observed a mean 30% reduction in liver volume. The majority 
      of patients declared satisfied or very satisfied. The adverse effects were mild, 
      of short duration, and not clinically relevant. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm 
      the acceptability, safety, and significant advantage of a very low-calorie 
      ketogenic diet for reducing weight and liver volume of patients in preparation 
      for bariatric surgery.

TI  - Gender Differences in Liver Steatosis and Fibrosis in Overweight and Obese 
      Patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease before and 
      after 8 Weeks of Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet.
LID - 10.3390/nu16101408 [doi]
LID - 1408
AB  - Obesity and metabolic syndrome are linked to steatotic liver disease (SLD), the 
      most common form of chronic liver disease. Lifestyle modifications and dieting 
      are strategies that can prevent metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver 
      disease (MASLD). The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is a helpful 
      treatment for MASLD and has been recommended for people affected by obesity; we 
      evaluated the effect of gender on steatosis and fibrosis in a cohort of 112 
      overweight or obese patients undergoing an eight-week treatment with a VLCKD. 
      Differences between the genders in terms of anthropometric measures, body 
      composition, and metabolic indicators were examined before, during, and after the 
      nutritional intervention. At baseline, there were significant differences between 
      men and women in terms of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, Homeostatic 
      Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting insulin, hepatic 
      markers, and lipid profile. Men had considerably higher levels of liver steatosis 
      (measured by CAP) and liver stiffness (measured by E) under basal conditions than 
      women. After the VLCKD, there were reductions in both genders of controlled 
      attenuation parameter (CAP), body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist 
      circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, fat 
      mass (FM), free fat mass (FFM), and fasting blood glucose, insulin, glycated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c), triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL) cholesterol, alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γGT), 
      and uric acid levels. Only in men, liver stiffness, aspartate aminotransferase 
      (AST), creatinine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels significantly decreased. 
      Moreover, men had significantly greater levels of liver steatosis: the male 
      gender featured an increase of 23.96 points of the Fibroscan CAP. Men exhibited 
      higher levels of steatosis and fibrosis than women, and these differences persist 
      despite VLCKD. These gender-specific variations in steatosis and fibrosis levels 
      could be caused by hormonal and metabolic factors, suggesting that different 
      therapeutic strategies might be required depending on the gender.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Inflammation and oxidative stress are the most probable 
      mechanistic link between obesity and its co-diseases with cancer among them. The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate whether the nutritional ketosis and weight loss 
      induced by a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) modulates the inflammatory 
      and oxidative stress profile, compared with a standard, balanced hypocaloric diet 
      (LCD) or bariatric surgery (BS) in patients with obesity. METHODS: The study was 
      performed in 79 patients with overweight or obesity and 32 normal-weight 
      volunteers as the control group. Patients with obesity underwent a weight 
      reduction therapy based on VLCKD, LCD or BS. The quantification of the 
      circulating levels of a multiplexing test of cytokines and carcinogenesis/aging 
      biomarkers, as well as of lipid peroxides and total antioxidant power, was 
      carried out. RESULTS: First, we observed that pro-inflammatory cytokines 
      increase, while anti-inflammatory cytokines decrease under excessive body weight. 
      Relevantly, when patients underwent weight loss strategies, it was shown that 
      energy-restricted and surgical strategies of weight loss induced changes in 
      circulating cytokine and lipid peroxides. This effect was more notable in 
      patients following the VLCKD than the LCD or BS and it was observed mainly in the 
      ketosis phase of the intervention. Particularly, IL-11, IL-12, IL-2, INF-γ, 
      INF-β, Pentraxin-3 or MMP1 changed after VLCKD. Whereas, APRIL, TWEAK, 
      osteocalcin and IL-28A increased after BS. CONCLUSION: As far as we know, this is 
      the first study that evaluate the time-course of cytokines and oxidative stress 
      markers after a VLCKD as compared with a standard LCD and BS. The observed 
      results support the immunomodulatory effect of nutritional ketosis induced by a 
      VLCKD synergistically with weight loss as a strategy to improve innate-immunity 
      and to prevent infections and carcinogenesis in patients with obesity.

TI  - Effects of very-low-calorie diet on body composition, metabolic state, and genes 
      expression: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 329-345
LID - 12103 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Very low-calorie diets (VLCDs, < 800 kcal day-1) and Ketogenic diet 
      (KD) are generally used as part of integrated intervention, medical monitoring 
      and a program of lifestyle modification, to improve a multitude of clinical 
      states. The effect of three different very low calories KD (VLCKD), with (VLCKD1) 
      or without (VLCKD2,3) synthetic amino acid replacement of the 50% protein intake, 
      were analyzed after weight loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical study used a 
      cross-over randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Obese subjects, who 
      were eligible for the study, were randomly (R) divided into three groups: one 
      intervention group (IG) and two control groups (CG1 and CG2). We comprehensively 
      analyzed body composition, serum metabolites, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), 
      nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NfKB), Chemokine 
      (C-C Motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression. RESULTS: After VLDKDs a significant 
      decreased in BMI was observed. TBF (kg) significantly decrease after VLCKD1 and 
      VLCKD3. After VLCKD2, a reduction of waist circumference (p = 0.02), FM L2-L5 (p 
      < 0.05) was observed. After VLCKD1 reduction of IMAT (p = 0.00), LDL-C (p = 0.00) 
      and HDL-C (p = 0.00) were observed. No significant changes of GH, ESR, and 
      fibrinogen were highlighted. CRP (p = 0.02) reduced significantly after VLCKD3. 
      Significant modulation of SOD1 expression (p = 0.009), CRP and decrease of 
      glucose levels (p = 0.03) were obtained after VLCKD3. CONCLUSIONS: This is the 
      first study that analyzes comprehensively body composition, metabolic profile, 
      and inflammation and oxidative stress genes expression after VLCKD. Our results 
      show the efficacy of VLCKD with synthetic aminoacidic protein replacement, for 
      the reduction of cardiovascular risk, without the development of sarcopenia and 
      activation of inflammatory and oxidative processes.

TI  - The Role of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet in Sympathetic Activation through 
      Cortisol Secretion in Male Obese Population.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10184230 [doi]
LID - 4230
AB  - Adipose tissue is considered an endocrine organ, and its excess compromises the 
      immune response and metabolism of hormones and nutrients. Furthermore, the 
      accumulation of visceral fat helps to increase the synthesis of cortisol. The 
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine system involved in 
      maintaining homeostasis in humans under physiological conditions and stress, and 
      cortisol is the main hormone of the HPA axis. It is known that a stress-induced 
      diet and cortisol reactivity to acute stress factors may be related to dietary 
      behavior. In obesity, to reduce visceral adipose tissue, caloric restriction is a 
      valid strategy. In light of this fact, the aim of this study was to assess the 
      effects of a commercial dietary ketosis program for weight loss on the 
      sympathetic nervous system and HPA axis, through evaluation of salivary cortisol 
      and GSR levels. Thirty obese subjects were recruited and assessed before and 
      after 8 weeks of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) intervention to evaluate 
      body composition and biochemical parameters. Salivary cortisol levels and GSR 
      significantly decreased after dietary treatment; in addition, body composition 
      and biochemical features were ameliorated. The VLCKD had a short-term positive 
      effect on the SNS and HPA axes regulating salivary cortisol levels. Finally, the 
      effects of the VLCKD on the SNS and HPA axis may lead to more individualized 
      treatment strategies that integrate obesity and stress and support the usefulness 
      of such therapeutic interventions in promoting the reduction of the individual 
      disease burden.

TI  - Effects of a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on the Fecal and Urinary Volatilome 
      in an Obese Patient Cohort: A Preliminary Investigation.
LID - 10.3390/nu15173752 [doi]
LID - 3752
AB  - Several recent studies deepened the strong connection between gut microbiota and 
      obesity. The effectiveness of the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has 
      been measured in terms of positive impact on the host homeostasis, but little is 
      known of the modification exerted on the intestinal metabolome. To inspect this 
      complex relationship, we analyzed both fecal and urinary metabolome in terms of 
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the GC-MS method in 25 obese patients that 
      were under VLCKD for eight weeks. Partial least square discriminant analysis 
      evidenced specific urinary and fecal metabolites whose profile can be considered 
      a signature of a partial restore toward the host eubiosis. Specifically, among 
      various keystone VOCs, the decreased concentration of four statistically 
      significant fecal esters (i.e., propanoic acid pentyl ester, butanoic acid hexyl 
      ester, butanoic acid pentyl ester, and pentanoic acid butyl ester) supports the 
      positive effect of VLCKD treatment. Our pilot study results suggest a potential 
      positive effect of VLCKD intervention affecting fecal and urinary volatilome 
      profiles from obese patients. Meta-omics techniques including the study of genes 
      and transcripts will help in developing new interventions useful in preventing or 
      treating obesity and its associated health problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing use of very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets 
      (VLCKD) in weight control and management of the metabolic syndrome there is a 
      paucity of research about effects of VLCKD on sport performance. Ketogenic diets 
      may be useful in sports that include weight class divisions and the aim of our 
      study was to investigate the influence of VLCKD on explosive strength 
      performance. METHODS: 8 athletes, elite artistic gymnasts (age 20.9 ± 5.5 yrs) 
      were recruited. We analyzed body composition and various performance aspects 
      (hanging straight leg raise, ground push up, parallel bar dips, pull up, squat 
      jump, countermovement jump, 30 sec continuous jumps) before and after 30 days of 
      a modified ketogenic diet. The diet was based on green vegetables, olive oil, 
      fish and meat plus dishes composed of high quality protein and virtually zero 
      carbohydrates, but which mimicked their taste, with the addition of some herbal 
      extracts. During the VLCKD the athletes performed the normal training program. 
      After three months the same protocol, tests were performed before and after 
      30 days of the athletes' usual diet (a typically western diet, WD). A one-way 
      Anova for repeated measurements was used. RESULTS: No significant differences 
      were detected between VLCKD and WD in all strength tests. Significant differences 
      were found in body weight and body composition: after VLCKD there was a decrease 
      in body weight (from 69.6 ± 7.3 Kg to 68.0 ± 7.5 Kg) and fat mass (from 5.3 ± 1.3 
      Kg to 3.4 ± 0.8 Kg p < 0.001) with a non-significant increase in muscle mass. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns of coaches and doctors about the possible 
      detrimental effects of low carbohydrate diets on athletic performance and the 
      well known importance of carbohydrates there are no data about VLCKD and strength 
      performance. The undeniable and sudden effect of VLCKD on fat loss may be useful 
      for those athletes who compete in sports based on weight class. We have 
      demonstrated that using VLCKD for a relatively short time period (i.e. 30 days) 
      can decrease body weight and body fat without negative effects on strength 
      performance in high level athletes.

AB  - The very-low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is recommended as an effective 
      dietary approach for the management of obesity. This study investigated changes 
      in circulating biomarkers of redox homeostasis induced by a multiphase VLCKD in 
      obese individuals. A total of 40 obese subjects were prescribed a multiphasic 
      VLCKD for eleven weeks. Anthropometric measurements, body composition parameters, 
      calorimetric measures, and standard laboratory markers of glucose and lipid 
      metabolism were evaluated at baseline (T(0)) and at the end of the dietary 
      intervention (T(1)). Additionally, circulating markers of oxidative damage and 
      antioxidant status were analyzed in serum and erythrocytes. Compared to T(0), at 
      T(1) the multiphase VLCKD induced significant weight loss and reduction of waist 
      circumference, with beneficial effects on body composition parameters and the 
      glucose/lipid biochemical profile. Moreover, a decrease in serum markers of 
      oxidative damage was reported at T(1), while no changes in serum markers of 
      antioxidant status and in erythrocyte redox markers were observed. In addition, a 
      significant association was found between variations in anthropometric 
      measurements, body composition, glucose metabolism parameters, and changes in 
      circulating markers of oxidative damage. Regression models showed that variation 
      in lipofuscin was significant predictor of changes in body mass index, fat mass, 
      visceral adiposity, and insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, this study 
      demonstrated that the multiphase VLCKD improves serum redox balance by reducing 
      markers of oxidative damage in obese individuals, highlighting the interplay 
      between adiposity, glucose metabolism, and redox homeostasis in the pathogenesis 
      of obesity. Furthermore, these data provide a rationale for future investigations 
      aimed at testing serum lipofuscin as a reliable redox marker in obesity.

TI  - Lysosomal Acid Lipase as a Molecular Target of the Very Low Carbohydrate 
      Ketogenic Diet in Morbidly Obese Patients: The Potential Effects on Liver 
      Steatosis and Cardiovascular Risk Factors.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8050621 [doi]
LID - 621
AB  - A very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) is an emerging technique to induce 
      a significant, well-tolerated, and rapid loss of body weight in morbidly obese 
      patients. The low activity of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) could be involved in 
      the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a common 
      feature in morbidly obese patients. Fifty-two obese patients suitable for a 
      bariatric surgery intervention underwent a 25-day-long VLCKD. The biochemical 
      markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the 
      brachial artery were measured before and after VLCKD. LAL activity was measured 
      using the dried blood spot technique in 20 obese patients and in a control group 
      of 20 healthy, normal-weight subjects. After VLCKD, we observed a significant 
      reduction in body mass index, fasting glucose, insulinemia, and lipid profile 
      parameters. No significant variation in FMD was observed. The number of patients 
      with severe liver steatosis significantly decreased. LAL activity significantly 
      increased, although the levels were not significantly different as compared to 
      the control group. In conclusion, VLCKD induces the activity of LAL in morbidly 
      obese subjects and reduces the secretion of all circulating lipoproteins. These 
      effects could be attributed to the peculiar composition of the diet, which is 
      particularly poor in carbohydrates and relatively rich in proteins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The challenge of addressing obesity persists in healthcare, 
      necessitating nuanced approaches and personalized strategies. This study aims to 
      evaluate the effects of diverse therapeutic interventions on anthropometric and 
      biochemical parameters in individuals with overweight and obesity within a 
      real-world clinical context. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 
      192 patients (141 females, 51 males) aged 18 to 75, with a BMI ranging from 25 to 
      30 (14.1%) and BMI ≥ 30 (85.9%), observed over a 12-month period at our 
      Endocrinology Unit. Treatment cohorts comprised individuals following different 
      regimens: Mediterranean Diet (MD), with an approximate daily intake of 1500 kcal 
      for women and 1800 kcal for men (71% patients); Ketogenic Diet (KD), utilizing 
      the VLCKD protocol characterized by a highly hypocaloric dietary 
      regimen < 800 kcal/day (14% patients); metformin, administered using the oral 
      formulation (5% patients); pharmacological intervention with GLP1-RA administered 
      via subcutaneous injection with incremental dosage (10% patients). Supply 
      constraints limited the efficacy of Liraglutide, whereas Semaglutide was excluded 
      from comparisons due to its unavailability for obesity without diabetes. Blood 
      tests were conducted to assess lipid profile, glycemic profile, and 
      anthropometric parameters, including BMI, waist circumference, and 
      waist-to-height ratio. RESULTS: Significant BMI changes were observed from 
      baseline to 6 months across MD, KD, and Liraglutide groups (p < 0.05). KD 
      exhibited notable reductions in waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio 
      within the initial quarter (p < 0.05), with a significant triglyceride decrease 
      after 6 months (p < 0.05), indicating its efficacy over MD. Liraglutide 
      demonstrated a substantial reduction in HbA1(c) levels in the first quarter 
      (p < 0.05). During the first three months, the ANOVA test on fasting blood 
      glucose showed a statistically significant impact of the time variable (p < 0.05) 
      rather than the specific treatments themselves (Liraglutide and KD), suggesting 
      that adherence during the early stages of therapy may be more critical than 
      treatment choice. CONCLUSIONS: Positive outcomes from targeted interventions, 
      whether pharmacological or dietary should encourage the exploration of 
      innovative, long-term strategies that include personalized treatment alternation. 
      The absence of standardized protocols underscores the importance of careful and 
      tailored planning in managing obesity as a chronic condition.

TI  - Effects of Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet on the Orexinergic System, Visceral 
      Adipose Tissue, and ROS Production.
LID - 10.3390/antiox8120643 [doi]
LID - 643
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caloric restriction is a valid strategy to reduce the visceral 
      adipose tissue (VAT) content in obese persons. Hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) is a 
      neuropeptide synthesized in the lateral hypothalamus that strongly modulates food 
      intake, thus influencing adipose tissue accumulation. Therapeutic diets in 
      obesity treatment may combine the advantages of caloric restriction and dietary 
      ketosis. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a very low calorie 
      ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in a population of obese patients. METHODS: Adiposity 
      parameters and orexin-A serum profiling were quantified over an 8 week period. 
      The effect of the VLCKD on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell 
      viability was evaluated, in vitro, by culturing Hep-G2 cells in the presence of 
      VLCKD sera. RESULTS: Dietary intervention induced significant effects on body 
      weight, adiposity, and blood chemistry parameters. Moreover, a selective 
      reduction in VAT was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Orexin-A 
      levels significantly increased after dietary treatment. Hep-G2 cell viability was 
      not affected after 24, 48, and 72 h incubation with patients' sera, before and 
      after the VLCKD. In the same model system, ROS production was not significantly 
      influenced by dietary treatment. CONCLUSION: The VLCKD exerts a positive effect 
      on VAT decrease, ameliorating adiposity and blood chemistry parameters. 
      Furthermore, short-term mild dietary ketosis does not appear to have a cytotoxic 
      effect, nor does it represent a factor capable of increasing oxidative stress. 
      Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows an 
      effect of the VLCKD upon the orexinergic system, supporting the usefulness of 
      such a therapeutic intervention in promoting obesity reduction in the individual 
      burden of this disease.

TI  - Phase angle as an easy diagnostic tool for the nutritionist in the evaluation of 
      inflammatory changes during the active stage of a very low-calorie ketogenic 
      diet.
PG  - 1591-1597
LID - 10.1038/s41366-022-01152-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) have recently 
      gained increasing interest for their anti-inflammatory effects. Phase angle 
      (PhA), a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived measure used as a 
      screening tool to assess inflammatory status in various clinical conditions has 
      recently been suggested as a novel predictor of inflammatory status in 
      correlation with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. PhA's 
      usefulness in monitoring inflammatory status changes in patients with obesity 
      during active phase VLCKD has not yet been explored. The aim of this pilot study 
      was to examine the role of PhA as a biomarker detecting early inflammatory status 
      changes in women with overweight and obesity 1 month into the active stage of a 
      VLCKD. METHODS-RESULTS: This uncontrolled, single-center, open-label pilot 
      clinical study investigated 260 consecutively enrolled Caucasian women aged 18-69 
      years (BMI 25.0-50.9 kg/m(2)) after 31 days of an active stage VLCKD. 
      Anthropometric measurements and PhA were assessed. hs-CRP levels were determined 
      by nephelometric assay. Dietary compliance, physical activity recommendations, 
      and ketosis status were tested weekly by telephone recall. At Day 31, BMI, WC, 
      and hs-CRP levels were observed to have decreased (∆-7.3 ± 2.9%, ∆-6.3 ± 5.0%, 
      and ∆-38.9 ± 45.6%; respectively), while PhA had increased (∆+8.6 ± 12.5%). 
      Changes in ∆ hs-CRP were significantly correlated with changes in BMI, WC, and 
      PhA (p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, the correlation 
      between changes in ∆ PhA and ∆ hs-CRP remained statistically significant, albeit 
      attenuated (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: This is the first study reporting how, along 
      with the expected rapid effect on body weight, PhA changes during active stage 
      VLKCD occurred very early on and independently of weight loss, and were 
      negatively associated with hs-CRP levels. These findings further support the 
      VLCKD as a first-line dietary intervention to obtain a rapid effect on the 
      obesity-related inflammatory status. They also suggest the possible role of PhA 
      as an easy diagnostic tool to detect inflammation, thereby avoiding blood 
      sampling and expensive biochemical assays. It is also posited that changes in PhA 
      could help nutritionists correctly plan the different stages of the VLCKD 
      protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that the efficacy with an intragastric 
      balloon decreases after the first 4 months of treatment. Aim of this study is to 
      evaluate if the association of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) can 
      improve the results in terms of weight loss parameters and co-morbidities, as 
      compared to usually prescribed low-calorie diet (LCD). METHODS: For the present 
      study (January 2016-June 2017), 80 patients (20 M/60 F, mean age 
      37.8 ± 6.1 years; excess weight 56 ± 10 kg; mean BMI 37.2 ± 3.8 kg/m(2)) 
      underwent Orbera positioning. After 4 months, they were randomized into two 
      groups according to the type of treatment: group A (Bioenterics intragastric 
      balloon - Orbera + VLCKD) (n = 40), and group B (Orbera + LCD) (n = 40). RESULTS: 
      All patients completed the study with good adherence to diet therapy treatment 
      allocation. After the 6-month treatment period, at time of Orbera removal, mean 
      weight loss was 19 kg and 12 kg in groups A and B respectively (p < 0.05). Mean 
      BMI was 28.9 ± 2.8 and 31.6 ± 3.1 kg/m(2) (p < 0.05), and %EWL was 33.1 ± 3.3 and 
      21.1 ± 2.9 (p < 0.05) in groups A and B respectively. During the last 2 months in 
      group A, the mean weight loss was 8 kg, while in Group B, the main weight loss 
      was 3 kg (p < 0.001). The VLCKD treatment induced a more significant reduction of 
      major comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      clearly indicates the efficacy of the prescription of very low-calorie ketogenic 
      diet improving the efficacy of intragastric balloon positioning.

TI  - An observational study of sequential protein-sparing, very low-calorie ketogenic

AB  - The impact of a rehabilitative multi-step dietary program consisting in different 
      diets has been scantily investigated. In an open-label study, 73 obese patients 
      underwent a two-phase weight loss (WL) program: a 3-week protein-sparing, very 
      low-calorie, ketogenic diet (<500 kcal/day; Oloproteic(®) Diet) and a 6-week 
      hypocaloric (25-30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight/day), low glycemic index, 
      Mediterranean-like diet (hypo-MD). Both phases improved visceral adiposity, liver 
      enzymes, GH levels, blood pressure and glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the 
      hypo-MD was responsible for a re-increase in blood lipids and glucose tolerance 
      parameters. Changes in visceral adiposity and glucose control-related variables 
      were more consistent in patients with metabolic syndrome. However, in these 
      patients the hypo-MD did not result in a consistent re-increase in glucose 
      control-related variables. A dietary program consisting in a ketogenic regimen 
      followed by a balanced MD appeared to be feasible and efficacious in reducing 
      cardiovascular risk, particularly in patients with metabolic syndrome.

TI  - LIMITED CARBOHYDRATE REFEEDING INSTRUCTION FOR LONG-TERM WEIGHT MAINTENANCE 
      FOLLOWING A KETOGENIC, VERY-LOW-CALORIE MEAL PLAN.
PG  - 649-656
LID - 10.4158/EP161383.OR [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Weight-loss maintenance following very-low-calorie meal plans is 
      poorly studied. This report describes weight-loss efficacy and predictors of 
      weight-loss maintenance of a ketogenic, very-low-calorie meal plan 
      (protein-sparing modified fast, PSMF) in people with obesity. METHODS: A total of 
      127 consecutive adults in the PSMF meal plan (27.2 ± 19.5 weeks) and 48 adults on 
      a conventional, hypocaloric meal plan (23.6 ± 20.8 weeks) were retrospectively 
      studied for percent weight change from baseline to end of intervention and at 6, 
      12, and 24 months postintervention. Baseline factors were analyzed for 
      correlations with weight-loss maintenance. RESULTS: At end of intervention, 
      weight loss from baseline was greater for the PSMF group compared to the 
      conventional intervention group (-12.4% vs. -2.6%; P<.001) but was similar 
      between groups by 12 months postintervention. PSMF subjects who attended 
      follow-up visits to receive instruction on gradual and limited carbohydrate 
      refeeding after ketosis saw significant weight loss at the end of PSMF compared 
      to those who did not follow-up to receive instruction (-17.5% vs. -8.0%; P<.001) 
      and maintained greater weight loss through 12 months post-PSMF (-9.8% vs. -1.5%; 
      P<.001). Higher baseline body mass index correlated with less weight loss at 12 
      months post-PSMF (P = .035). CONCLUSION: PSMF results in effective short-term 
      weight loss of more than 5% from baseline weight. Follow-up for limited 
      carbohydrate refeeding instruction is important for weight-loss maintenance up to 
      2 years after initial weight loss. ABBREVIATIONS: BMI = body mass index; PSMF = 
      protein-sparing modified fast.

AB  - This study compared the effects on weight as well as on metabolic parameters and 
      liver size of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet versus a Mediterranean diet in 
      patients with morbid obesity preparing to undergo bariatric surgery. This 
      prospective comparison study evaluated patients 18-65 years of age who enrolled 
      for bariatric surgery. Study duration was limited to an immediate preoperative 
      period of 15 days. The very low-calorie ketogenic diet incorporated 
      10-12 kcal/kg/day of energy and 1-1.2 g/kg of protein using Kalibra (Societa 
      Dietetica Medica) (VLCKD-SDM). The Mediterranean diet (MD) included 15-20% 
      protein, 45-50% carbohydrate, and 25-35% fat. Changes in body mass index (BMI), 
      liver size, and anthropometric and metabolic measurements were assessed. Between 
      January 2016 and March 2017, of 45 patients enrolled, 30 completed the study 
      (VLCKD-SDM, n = 15; MD, n = 15). Respective median BMI loss after VLCKD-SDM was 
      2.7 kg/m(2) versus MD 1.4 kg/m(2) (p < 0.05); median fat percentage reduction was 
      3.2 units versus 1.7 units (p < 0.05). Median liver size decreased 5.5% in the 
      VLCKD-SDM group versus 1.7% in the MD group (p < 0.05). Median total cholesterol, 
      and LDL levels decreased in both groups (p < 0.05), with greater relative 
      decreases in the VLCKD-SDM group. Short-term preoperative diet-based weight loss 
      in patients with morbid obesity preparing for bariatric surgery was significantly 
      greater following a very low-calorie ketogenic diet versus a Mediterranean diet. 
      The very low-calorie diet also significantly improved anthropometric and 
      metabolic parameters and reduced preoperative liver size above that of the MD.

TI  - Dynamics of Gut Microbiota and Clinical Variables after Ketogenic and 
      Mediterranean Diets in Drug-Naïve Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and 
      Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/metabo12111092 [doi]
LID - 1092
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the most common form of diabetes, is a 
      progressive chronic metabolic disease that has increasingly spread worldwide, 
      enhancing the mortality rate, particularly from cardiovascular diseases (CVD). 
      Lifestyle improvement through diet and physical activity is, together with drug 
      treatment, the cornerstone of T2DM management. The Mediterranean diet (MD), which 
      favors a prevalence of unprocessed vegetable foods and a reduction in red meats 
      and industrial foods, without excluding any food category, is usually 
      recommended. Recently, scientific societies have promoted a very low-calorie 
      ketogenic diet (VLCKD), a multiphasic protocol that limits carbohydrates and then 
      gradually re-introduces them, with a favorable outcome on body weight and 
      metabolic parameters. Indeed, gut microbiota (GM) modifications have been linked 
      to overweight/obesity and metabolic alterations typical of T2DM. Diet is known to 
      affect GM largely, but only a few studies have investigated the effects of VLCKD 
      on GM, especially in T2DM. In this study, we have compared anthropometric, 
      biochemical, lifestyle parameters, the quality of life, and the GM of eleven 
      patients with recently diagnosed T2DM and overweight or obesity, randomly 
      assigned to two groups of six and five patients who followed the VLCKD (KETO) or 
      hypocaloric MD (MEDI) respectively; parameters were recorded at baseline (T0) and 
      after two (T2) and three months (T3). The results showed that VLCKD had more 
      significant beneficial effects than MD on anthropometric parameters, while 
      biochemical improvements did not statistically differ. As for the GM, despite the 
      lack of significant results regarding the alpha and beta diversity, and the 
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio between the two groups, in the KETO group, a 
      significant increase in beneficial microbial taxa such as Verrucomicrobiota 
      phylum with its members Verrucomicrobiae, Verrucomicrobiales, Akkermansiaceae, 
      and Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae family, Eubacterium spp., and a reduction in 
      microbial taxa previously associated with obesity (Firmicutes and 
      Actinobacteriota) or other diseases (Alistipes) was observed both at T2 and T3. 
      With regards to the MEDI group, variations were limited to a significant increase 
      in Actinobacteroidota phylum at T2 and T3 and Firmicutes phylum at T3. Moreover, 
      a metagenomic alteration linked to some metabolic pathways was found exclusively 
      in the KETO group. In conclusion, both dietary approaches allowed patients to 
      improve their state of health, but VLCKD has shown better results on body 
      composition as well as on GM profile.

AB  - Previous studies investigated low-calorie diets (LCD), very-low-calorie diets 
      (VLCD), and very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in relation to weight loss 
      and outcomes for bariatric surgery patients. However, the overall effects of 
      these diets on various outcomes remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the 
      impact of preoperative restricted calorie diets on weight, body mass index (BMI), 
      operation time (OT), and hospital stay (HS) in bariatric surgery patients. 
      Seventeen articles were analyzed, revealing the highest weight loss (-8.62) and 
      BMI reduction (-5.75) with VLCKD. Due to insufficient data, the impact of these 
      diets on OT and HS could not be determined. Further interventional studies are 
      required to determine the ideal preoperative diet that achieves optimal weight 
      loss, patient compliance, tolerance, acceptance, and surgical outcomes.

TI  - Short-Term Physiological Effects of a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet: Effects on 
      Adiponectin Levels and Inflammatory States.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21093228 [doi]
LID - 3228
AB  - Adipose tissue is a multifunctional organ involved in many physiological and 
      metabolic processes through the production of adipokines and, in particular, 
      adiponectin. Caloric restriction is one of the most important strategies against 
      obesity today. The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) represents a type of 
      caloric restriction with very or extremely low daily food energy consumption. 
      This study aimed to investigate the physiological effects of a VLCKD on 
      anthropometric and biochemical parameters such as adiponectin levels, as well as 
      analyzing oligomeric profiles and cytokine serum levels in obese subjects before 
      and after a VLCKD. Twenty obese subjects were enrolled. At baseline and after 
      eight weeks of intervention, anthropometric and biochemical parameters, such as 
      adiponectin levels, were recorded. Our findings showed a significant change in 
      the anthropometric and biochemical parameters of these obese subjects before and 
      after a VLCKD. We found a negative correlation between adiponectin and lipid 
      profile, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which 
      confirmed the important involvement of adiponectin in metabolic and inflammatory 
      diseases. We demonstrated the beneficial short-term effects of a VLCKD not only 
      in the treatment of obesity but also in the establishment of obesity-correlated 
      diseases.

TI  - Comparison of low fat and low carbohydrate diets on circulating fatty acid 
      composition and markers of inflammation.
PG  - 65-77
AB  - Abnormal distribution of plasma fatty acids and increased inflammation are 
      prominent features of metabolic syndrome. We tested whether these components of 
      metabolic syndrome, like dyslipidemia and glycemia, are responsive to 
      carbohydrate restriction. Overweight men and women with atherogenic dyslipidemia 
      consumed ad libitum diets very low in carbohydrate (VLCKD) (1504 
      kcal:%CHO:fat:protein = 12:59:28) or low in fat (LFD) (1478 kcal:%CHO:fat:protein 
      = 56:24:20) for 12 weeks. In comparison to the LFD, the VLCKD resulted in an 
      increased proportion of serum total n-6 PUFA, mainly attributed to a marked 
      increase in arachidonate (20:4n-6), while its biosynthetic metabolic 
      intermediates were decreased. The n-6/n-3 and arachidonic/eicosapentaenoic acid 
      ratio also increased sharply. Total saturated fatty acids and 16:1n-7 were 
      consistently decreased following the VLCKD. Both diets significantly decreased 
      the concentration of several serum inflammatory markers, but there was an overall 
      greater anti-inflammatory effect associated with the VLCKD, as evidenced by 
      greater decreases in TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, E-selectin, I-CAM, and PAI-1. 
      Increased 20:4n-6 and the ratios of 20:4n-6/20:5n-3 and n-6/n-3 are commonly 
      viewed as pro-inflammatory, but unexpectedly were consistently inversely 
      associated with responses in inflammatory proteins. In summary, a very low 
      carbohydrate diet resulted in profound alterations in fatty acid composition and 
      reduced inflammation compared to a low fat diet.

      cardiometabolic and anthropometric markers in healthy adults: A randomised 
      clinical trial.
PG  - e6273
LID - 10.7717/peerj.6273 [doi]
LID - e6273
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diets are useful for treating a 
      range of health conditions, but there is little research evaluating the degree of 
      carbohydrate restriction on outcome measures. This study compares anthropometric 
      and cardiometabolic outcomes between differing carbohydrate-restricted diets. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our hypothesis was that moderate carbohydrate restriction is easier to 
      maintain and more effective for improving cardiometabolic health markers than 
      greater restriction. DESIGN: A total of 77 healthy participants were randomised 
      to a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), 
      or moderate-low carbohydrate diet (MCD), containing 5%, 15% and 25% total energy 
      from carbohydrate, respectively, for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and metabolic 
      health measures were taken at baseline and at 12 weeks. Using ANOVA, both within 
      and between-group outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: Of 77 participants, 39 (51%) 
      completed the study. In these completers overall, significant reductions in 
      weight and body mass index occurred ((mean change) 3.7 kg/m(2); 95% confidence 
      limits (CL): 3.8, 1.8), along with increases in high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (0.49 mmol/L; 95% CL; 0.06, 
      0.92; p = 0.03), and total cholesterol concentrations (0.11 mmol/L; 95% CL; 0.00, 
      0.23; p = 0.05). Triglyceride (TG) levels were reduced by 0.12 mmol/L (95% CL; 
      -0.20, 0.02; p = 0.02). No significant changes occurred between groups. The 
      largest improvements in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and TG and 
      anthropometric changes occurred for the VLCKD group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets have a positive effect on markers of health. 
      Adherence to the allocation of carbohydrate was more easily achieved in MCD, and 
      LCD groups compared to VLCKD and there were comparable improvements in weight 
      loss and waist circumference and greater improvements in HDL-c and TG with 
      greater carbohydrate restriction.

AB  - Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in Western countries and is a strong 
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite the constant recommendations of 
      health care organizations regarding the importance of weight control, this goal 
      often fails. Although there is a common agreement about the concept that exercise 
      and diet are two key factors for the control of body weight, the ideal amount and 
      type of exercise and also the ideal diet for weight control are still under 
      debate. A widely accepted nutritional regime is the Mediterranean diet that has 
      evident health benefits although less attention has been paid to see if the 
      effects are due to other lifestyle factors which may contribute to the health 
      benefits perhaps as much as specific food choices. There are several other 
      options available to the physician that may produce good weight loss results in 
      the short/medium term and also for maintenance of the goal achieved. One of these 
      strategies is the ketogenic diet or VLCKD (very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet) 
      that has been widely studied in recent years. Most studies show that this diet 
      has a solid physiological and biochemical basis which is able to induce effective 
      weight loss and improvement of several parameters of cardiovascular risk. This 
      review discusses the physiological basis of VLCKD and the main applications 
      together with its strengths and weaknesses compared to common dietary 
      recommendations.

TI  - Weight loss, changes in body composition and inflammatory status after a very 
      low-energy ketogenic therapy (VLEKT): does gender matter?
PG  - 949

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering differences in body composition and inflammatory status 
      between sexes, as well as recent recommendations advocating for personalized 
      dietary approaches, this study aimed to explore how sex influences weight loss, 
      changes in body composition, and inflammatory status in subjects with grade I and 
      II obesity undergoing a 45-day of the Very Low-Energy Ketogenic Therapy (VLEKT). 
      METHODS: Participants (21 premenopausal females and 21 males), included in the 
      study adhered to the 45-day of the VLEKT and underwent assessments of 
      anthropometric parameters (weight, height, body mass index-BMI -, and waist 
      circumference), body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 
      inflammatory status measured by high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) 
      levels at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, premenopausal 
      females and males did not differ in BMI (p = 0.100) and hs-CRP levels 
      (p = 0.948). Males demonstrated overall larger benefits than premenopausal 
      females from the VLEKT in terms of weight loss (Δ% = - 11.63 ± 1.76 vs 
      - 8.95 ± 1.65 kg, p < 0.001), fat mass (Δ% = - 30.84 ± 12.00 vs -21.36 ± 4.65 kg, 
      p = 0.002), and hs-CRP levels (Δ% = - 41.42 ± 21.35 vs - 22.38 ± 17.30 mg/L, 
      p = 0.003). Of interest, in males phase angle values are statistically improved 
      compared to female (Δ% = 17.11 ± 9.00 vs 7.05 ± 3.30°, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      These findings underscore the importance of considering sex-specific responses in 
      personalized obesity treatment strategies, particularly dietary interventions 
      like VLEKTs.

TI  - Very-low-calorie ketogenic diet with aminoacid supplement versus very low

      double-blind study.
PG  - 2613-21

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity plays a relevant pathophysiological role in the development of 
      health problems, arising as result of complex interaction of genetic, nutritional 
      and metabolic factors. We conducted a dietary intervention case-control 
      randomized trial, to compare the effectiveness on body composition of two 
      nutritional protocols: a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), integrated 
      by an aminoacid supplement with whey protein, and very low restricted-calorie 
      diet (VLCD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical study was conducted with a 
      randomized case-control in which twenty-five healthy subjects gave informed 
      consent to participate in the interventional study and were evaluated for their 
      health and nutritional status, by anthropometric, and body composition 
      evaluation. RESULTS: The results of this pilot study show that a diet low in 
      carbohydrates, associated with a decreased caloric intake, is effective in weight 
      loss. After VLCKD, versus VLCD, no significant differences in body lean of the 
      trunk, body lean distribution (android and gynoid), total body lean were observed 
      (p > 0.05). After VLCKD, no increasing of sarcopenia frequency, according ASSMI, 
      was observed. DISCUSSION: Many studies have shown the effectiveness of the 
      ketogenic diet on weight loss; even if not know how to work effectively, as some 
      researchers believe that the weight loss is due to reduced calorie intake, 
      satiety could also be induced by the effect of the proteins, rather than the 
      low-carbohydrates. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study showed that a VLCKD was highly 
      effective in terms of body weight reduction without to induce lean body mass 
      loss, preventing the risk of sarcopenia. Further clinical trials are needed on a 
      larger population and long-term body weight maintenance and risk factors 
      management effects of VLCKD. There is no doubt, however, that a proper dietary 
      approach would impact significantly on the reduction of public expenditure costs, 
      in view of prospective data on increasing the percentage of obese people in our 
      nation.

AB  - The dramatic rise in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes has become a major 
      global public health issue. "Prediabetes" is the term used for individuals whose 
      glucose levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are too high to be 
      considered normal. Prediabetes is associated with obesity, especially visceral 
      obesity, is a high risk state for diabetes. Obesity management can delay the 
      progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and is beneficial in the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the strategy of weight loss there are several 
      dietary approaches available, divided between low calories diet and very 
      low-calorie diets (VLCDs). VLCDs include the very-low-carbohydrate diet (VLCKD) 
      can lead to a state of ketosis. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has long been identified as 
      an incurable chronic disease; on the contrary, there is evidence that the 
      reversibility of type 2 diabetes is achievable using very low calorie diets or 
      carbohydrate restriction diets. This report provides an update on the scientific 
      evidence relating to highly low-calorie diets and the opinion of the President of 
      the Italian Obesity Network.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is the most effective method of weight reduction 
      among patients suffering from morbid obesity. Reduction of body weight before 
      surgery is an important element. The aim of the study was to present the current 
      knowledge on preoperative weight reduction and diet for this purpose. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: To achieve the aims of the paper, articles available in the PubMed / 
      MEDLINE database published in 2005-2020 were used, as well as the guidelines of 
      societies such as Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Chapter of the Association of 
      Polish Surgeons, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, The Obesity 
      Society and American Society for Metabolic &amp; Bariatric Surgery, International 
      Federation for Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders-European Chapter and 
      European Association for the Study of Obesity. RESULTS: Studies show that even a 
      modest reduction in weight in the early preoperative period facilitates surgery 
      and reduces the number of complications. The available data do not support the 
      effect of preoperative weight loss on increased postoperative weight loss. The 
      use of balanced, energy-restricted diet in the preoperative period prepares the 
      patient for changes in the way of nutrition, which improves the nutritional 
      status of patient. Low calorie (LCD) or very low calorie (VLCD) diet can be an 
      effective method of weight loss before surgery, however, this approach does not 
      allow to modify eating habits. The use of a very low calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD) remains under discussion. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for large 
      randomized trials to assess short and long term benefits of preoperative weight 
      loss and methods of weight loss among patients qualified for bariatric surgery, 
      also the standardization of nutritional management in the preoperative period.

TI  - The relationship between preoperative weight loss and intra and post-bariatric 
      surgery complications: an appraisal of the current preoperative nutritional 
      strategies.
PG  - 10230-10238
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2022.2074963 [doi]
AB  - Preoperative weight loss before a bariatric surgery reduces long-term 
      complications, but there is no solid evidence for short-term or perioperative 
      complications. This review highlights recent evidence on dietary protocols and 
      the possible correlation between weight loss and surgical complications. Updated 
      evidence was searched in PubMedDirect with the terms "preoperative very 
      low-calorie diet or very-low-calorie ketogenic diet or low-fat diet or 
      intermittent fasting or Mediterranean diet and bariatric surgery or bariatric 
      surgery complications." The main characteristics of each diet, achievements 
      related to weight loss, liver reduction, peri and postoperative outcomes, 
      surgical complications, tolerance, and adherence to the diet are presented from 
      the selected studies. There are few reports about the Mediterranean diet as a 
      strategy to reach these goals. The VLCKD has been associated with better body 
      weight reduction and lesser postoperative complications risk. However, the 
      results in animal models are still controversial. When comparing VLCD with an 
      LCD, there is no apparent superiority between one against the other one. However, 
      LCD has shown better tolerance and adherence than VLCD. There is still a need for 
      more controlled studies to define the best preoperative dietary treatment for 
      weight loss before bariatric surgery since there are controversial positions 
      regarding this issue.

TI  - Effect of very low-calorie ketogenic diet in combination with omega-3 on 
      inflammation, satiety hormones, body composition, and metabolic markers. A pilot 
      study in class I obese subjects.
PG  - 129-136
LID - 10.1007/s12020-021-02860-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of a VLCKD combined with omega-3 
      supplementation (VLCKD diet only lasted for some weeks, and it was followed by a 
      non-ketogenic LCD for the rest of the study period) on body composition, visceral 
      fat, satiety hormones, inflammatory and metabolic markers. METHODS: It has been 
      performed a pilot open label study lasted 90 days, in a cohort of 12 women with 
      class I obesity aged 18 to 65 years. Data on body composition (evaluated by Dual 
      X-Ray Absorptiometry-DXA), visceral fat, satiety hormones, inflammatory and 
      metabolic markers were recorded. RESULTS: This study showed a body weight 
      reduction mean difference over time of -13.7 kg and the waist circumference mean 
      difference decrease of -13.3 cm. Also, the fat mass (FM) decreased-9.1 kg and 
      visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-0.41 kg. No effects on fat-free mass (FFM) have 
      been reported. Improvements were observed in the satiety hormones, with increased 
      ghrelin and decreased leptin, and also in the metabolic profiles. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      VLCKD combined with omega-3 supplementation appears to be an effective strategy 
      for promoting an high loss of FM with preservation of FFM in patients with class 
      I obesity.

TI  - A Multi-Omics Approach to Disclose Metabolic Pathways Impacting Intestinal 
      Permeability in Obese Patients Undergoing Very Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet.
LID - 10.3390/nu16132079 [doi]
LID - 2079
AB  - A very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) impacts host metabolism in people 
      marked by an excess of visceral adiposity, and it affects the microbiota 
      composition in terms of taxa presence and relative abundances. As a matter of 
      fact, there is little available literature dealing with microbiota differences in 
      obese patients marked by altered intestinal permeability. With the aim of 
      inspecting consortium members and their related metabolic pathways, we inspected 
      the microbial community profile, together with the set of volatile organic 
      compounds (VOCs) from untargeted fecal and urine metabolomics, in a cohort made 
      of obese patients, stratified based on both normal and altered intestinal 
      permeability, before and after VLCKD administration. Based on the taxa relative 
      abundances, we predicted microbiota-derived metabolic pathways whose variations 
      were explained in light of our cohort symptom picture. A totally different number 
      of statistically significant pathways marked samples with altered permeability, 
      reflecting an important shift in microbiota taxa. A combined analysis of taxa, 
      metabolic pathways, and metabolomic compounds delineates a set of markers that is 
      useful in describing obesity dysfunctions and comorbidities.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles Modulate Liver Cells Viability and Reactive Oxygen Species 
      in Patients Following a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet.
LID - 10.3390/nu16152386 [doi]
LID - 2386
AB  - The VLCKD is a diet recognized to promote rapid fat mobilization and reduce 
      inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and liver fibrosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
      mediate cell-to-cell communication. The aim of the study is to investigate the 
      role of circulating EVs in cell proliferation, ketone bodies, and ROS production 
      in patients on an 8-week VLCKD regimen. Participants were classified as 
      responders (R) or non-responders (NR) to VLCKD treatment based on their fibroscan 
      results. In vitro experiments with the hepatic cell lines HEPA-RG (normal 
      hepatocytes) and LX-2 (stellate cells) were conducted to investigate the effects 
      of circulating EVs on cell viability, ROS production, and ketone body presence. 
      The findings reveal a notable reduction in cell viability in both cell lines when 
      treated with exosomes (EXOs). In contrast, treatment with microvesicles (MVs) did 
      not appear to affect cell viability, which remained unchanged. Additionally, the 
      levels of ketone bodies measured in urine were not consistently correlated with 
      the reduction of fibrosis in responders (R). Similarly, an increase in ketone 
      bodies was observed in non-responders (NR), which was also not aligned with the 
      expected reduction in fibrosis. This inconsistency stands in stark contrast to 
      the levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which exhibited a clear and 
      consistent pattern in accordance with the dietary intervention. Finally, in this 
      preliminary study, ROS has been identified as a potential diet adherence marker 
      for VLCKD patients; the ROS levels reliably follow the progression of the 
      fibrosis response, providing a more accurate reflection of the therapeutic 
      effects.

TI  - Examining the Efficacy of a Very-Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet on 
      Cardiovascular Health in Adults with Mildly Elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein 
      Cholesterol in an Open-Label Pilot Study.
PG  - 94-103
LID - 10.1089/met.2021.0042 [doi]
AB  - Background: The objective of this open-label pilot study was to investigate the 
      efficacy of a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), known as Nic's 
      Ketogenic Diet, for 140 days on cardiometabolic markers in healthy adults with 
      mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Methods: Study 
      assessments were conducted at Day 0, 28, 56, 70, 84, 112, and 140, and weight and 
      blood pressure (BP) were measured and fasting blood was collected for analysis of 
      plasma lipids. A DEXA scan was performed and body mass index recorded on Day 0, 
      70, and 140. Blood glucose, inflammatory, and thyroid markers were measured on 
      Day 0 and 140. Compliance was assessed using weekly 3-day food records and daily 
      blood glucose and ketone monitoring. Results: The results showed that body fat 
      percentage decreased by 2.25% and 4.41% at Day 70 and 140, respectively 
      (P ≤ 0.012). Significant reductions in android, gynoid, and android/gynoid fat 
      ratio and increases in muscle mass occurred by Day 70 and 140. Total cholesterol, 
      LDL-C, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased and systolic BP 
      and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were decreased at Day 140 (P < 0.05). Following 
      this VLCKD for 140 days was found to be safe and was well tolerated. Conclusion: 
      The VLCKD showed beneficial changes in body composition and cardiometabolic 
      markers in eutrophic and overweight participants in a 140-day study suggesting a 
      future role for this diet in populations at cardiovascular disease risk. Future 
      research with larger sample size in a randomized double blind clinical trial is 
      warranted to confirm these results. Clinical Trial Registration number: 
      NCT04195594.

TI  - Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet in Women 
      with Obesity and Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis: A Pilot Interventional Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu16193236 [doi]
LID - 3236
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a major risk factor for knee osteoarthritis 
      (OA), and weight loss is crucial for its management. This pilot study explores 
      the effects of a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) in women with obesity 
      and symptomatic knee OA. METHODS: Women with symptomatic knee OA and obesity, 
      defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m(2), were eligible for the VLCKD 
      protocol. The intervention included a ketogenic phase from baseline (T0) to the 
      8th week (T8), followed by a progressive reintroduction of carbohydrates over the 
      next 12 weeks, ending at the 20th week (T20). Body mass index (BMI), the Western 
      Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index, the EuroQol 5D 
      (EQ-5D), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were assessed at all 
      time points. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the 
      association between BMI and patient-reported outcomes across the study period. 
      RESULTS: Twenty participants started the study, but four discontinued the 
      intervention, with two of these being due to adverse effects. The mean age of the 
      16 patients who completed the 20-week program was 57.3 ± 5.5 years, and their 
      mean BMI was 40.0 ± 4.8 kg/m(2). The mean BMI significantly decreased to 37.5 ± 
      4.5 at T4, 36.3 ± 4.6 at T8, and 34.8 ± 4.8 at T20 (all p < 0.001 compared to 
      baseline). The total WOMAC score improved from a mean of 43.6 ± 16.9 at T0 to 
      30.2 ± 12.8 at T4 (p = 0.005) and further to 24.7 ± 10.6 at T8 (p = 0.001) and to 
      24.8 ± 15.9 at T20 (p = 0.005). The reduction in BMI was significantly correlated 
      with the improvements in WOMAC, EQ-5D, and SF-36 over time. No major adverse 
      effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 20-week VLCKD in women with obesity and 
      knee OA significantly reduced their weight and improved their outcomes, 
      warranting further research. This trial is registered with number NCT05848544 on 
      ClinicalTrials.gov.

TI  - VLCKD in Combination with Physical Exercise Preserves Skeletal Muscle Mass in 
      Sarcopenic Obesity after Severe COVID-19 Disease: A Case Report.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10030573 [doi]
LID - 573
AB  - The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity is increasing worldwide, with a strong 
      impact on public health and the national health care system. Sarcopenic obesity 
      consists of fat depot expansion and associated systemic low-grade inflammation, 
      exacerbating the decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength. Dietary approach 
      and physical exercise represent essential tools for reducing body weight and 
      preserving muscle mass and function in subjects with sarcopenic obesity. This 
      case report describes the effects of a dietary intervention, based on a 
      Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) combined with physical exercise, on body 
      composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, and muscle strength in a woman with 
      sarcopenic obesity, two weeks after hospitalization for bilateral interstitial 
      pneumonia due to COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to 
      describe the efficacy of a combined approach intervention including VLCKD along 
      with physical exercise, in reducing fat mass, improving metabolic profile, and 
      preserving skeletal muscle performance in a patient with obesity, soon after 
      severe COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Objective: the aim of the current work was to evaluate the response time to a 
      method of weight loss that includes dietary guidelines, physical exercise and 
      emotional support. The response was defined as a loss of 10% of the baseline 
      weight. Methods: data was obtained from the patients' record recruited in Promet 
      Lipoinflamación, an observational study of real world data in obese or overweight 
      patients treated with a multidisciplinary method and based initially on a 
      very-low-calorie ketogenic (VLCK) diet. Weight loss rate was evaluated through a 
      survival analysis Kaplan-Meier and related factors through Cox regression). 
      Results: 6,369 subjects were included and 74.4% managed to reach a weight loss of 
      10% in a mean time of 57.64 days (IC 95%: 56.95-58.33). The factors associated 
      with a greater probability of reaching a loss of 10% or more were male gender 
      (RR: 1.37, p < 0.001), obesity types I, II and III vs. overweight (RR: 1.24, p < 
      0.001, 1.26, p < 0.001 and 1.22, p < 0.001, respectively) and young age vs. more 
      than 55 years old (RR: 2.17, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Results obtained through 
      real clinical practice show that the method produces fast and intense weight 
      loss. Three out of four patients lost at least 10% of body weight in an average 
      of 58 days.

TI  - Effect of ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts and low 
      carbohydrates/high-protein meals on weight, cardiovascular risk factors, body 
      composition and diet compliance in Italian council employees.
PG  - 112
LID - 10.1186/1475-2891-10-112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increased interest in recent years in very low 
      carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) that, even though they are much discussed 
      and often opposed, have undoubtedly been shown to be effective, at least in the 
      short to medium term, as a tool to tackle obesity, hyperlipidemia and some 
      cardiovascular risk factors. For this reason the ketogenic diet represents an 
      interesting option but unfortunately suffers from a low compliance. The aim of 
      this pilot study is to ascertain the safety and effects of a modified ketogenic 
      diet that utilizes ingredients which are low in carbohydrates but are formulated 
      to simulate its aspect and taste and also contain phytoextracts to add beneficial 
      effects of important vegetable components. METHODS: The study group consisted of 
      106 Rome council employees with a body mass index of ≥ 25, age between 18 and 65 
      years (19 male and 87 female; mean age 48.49 ± 10.3). We investigated the effects 
      of a modified ketogenic diet based on green vegetables, olive oil, fish and meat 
      plus dishes composed of high quality protein and virtually zero carbohydrate but 
      which mimic their taste, with the addition of some herbal extracts (KEMEPHY 
      ketogenic Mediterranean with phytoextracts). Calories in the diet were unlimited. 
      Measurements were taken before and after 6 weeks of diet. RESULTS: There were no 
      significant changes in BUN, ALT, AST, GGT and blood creatinine. We detected a 
      significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in BMI (31.45 Kg/m2 to 29.01 Kg/m2), body 
      weight (86.15 kg to 79.43 Kg), percentage of fat mass (41.24% to 34.99%), waist 
      circumference (106.56 cm to 97.10 cm), total cholesterol (204 mg/dl to 181 
      mg/dl), LDLc (150 mg/dl to 136 mg/dl), triglycerides (119 mg/dl to 93 mg/dl) and 
      blood glucose (96 mg/dl to 91 mg/dl). There was a significant (p < 0.0001) 
      increase in HDLc (46 mg/dl to 52 mg/dl). CONCLUSIONS: The KEMEPHY diet lead to 
      weight reduction, improvements in cardiovascular risk markers, reduction in waist 
      circumference and showed good compliance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has been associated with a 
      significant reduction in visceral adipose tissue and ketone bodies that likely 
      possess antiinflammatory properties. We evaluated the efficacy of an aggressive 
      weight-loss (WL) program with a ketogenic induction phase as first-line treatment 
      for chronic plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Adult patients who were overweight or 
      obese and drug-naïve (i.e., never treated, excluding the use of topical 
      emollients; n = 37; 30% men; age: 43.1 ± 13.8 y) with stable chronic plaque 
      psoriasis underwent a 10-wk, 2-phase WL program consisting of a 4-wk 
      protein-sparing, VLCKD (<500 kcal/d; 1.2 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight/d) 
      and 6-wk balanced, hypocaloric (25-30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight/d), 
      Mediterranean-like diet. The primary endpoint was the reduction in Psoriasis Area 
      and Severity Index (PASI) score at wk 10. Major secondary endpoints included PASI 
      score responses of ≥50% and ≥75%, reduction in body surface area involved, 
      improvement in itch severity (visual analogue scale), and Dermatology Life 
      Quality Index score at wk 10. RESULTS: With a mean body weight reduction of 12.0% 
      (-10.6 kg), the dietary intervention resulted in a significant reduction in PASI 
      (baseline score: 13.8 ± 6.9; range, 7-32), with a mean change of -10.6 (95% 
      confidence interval, -12.8 to -8.4; P < 0.001). PASI score responses of ≥50% and 
      ≥75% were recorded in 36 patients (97.3%) and 24 patients (64.9%), respectively. 
      Treatment also resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the body 
      surface area involved (-17.4%) and an improvement in itch severity (-33.2 points) 
      and Dermatology Life Quality Index score (-13.4 points). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      drug-naïve adult overweight patients with stable chronic plaque psoriasis, an 
      aggressive dietary WL program consisting of a VLCKD, followed by a balanced, 
      hypocaloric, Mediterranean-like diet, appeared to be an effective first-line 
      strategy to reduce disease severity.

TI  - Weight loss normalizes enhanced expression of the oncogene survivin in visceral 
      adipose tissue and blood leukocytes from individuals with obesity.
PG  - 206-216
LID - 10.1038/s41366-020-0630-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Survivin is an oncogene associated with a decrease in 
      apoptosis, an increase in tumor growth, and poor clinical outcome of diverse 
      malignancies. A correlation between obesity, cancer, and survivin is reported in 
      the literature. To date, the impact of weight loss on change in survivin levels 
      is understudied. This study was aimed at: (1) comparing survivin levels in 
      adipose tissue (AT) from lean and obese animal models and evaluating changes 
      after weight loss induced by energy restriction and/or exercise; (2) comparing 
      survivin levels in normal weighted and obese humans and evaluating changes in 
      survivin levels after weight loss induced by a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet 
      (VLCKD) or bariatric surgery in AT and/or blood leukocytes (PBL/PBMCs). 
      SUBJECTS/METHODS: Survivin expression was evaluated in subcutaneous (SAT) and 
      visceral (VAT) AT derived from animal models of monogenic (Zucker rats) and 
      diet-induced obesity (Sprague Dawley rats and C57BL/6J mice) and after a 4-week 
      weight-loss protocol of energy restriction and/or exercise. Plasma was used to 
      measure the inflammatory status. Survivin expression was also evaluated in PBMCs 
      from patients with obesity and compared with normal weight, in PBLs after VLCKD, 
      and in SAT and/or PBLs after bariatric surgery. RESULTS: Survivin expression was 
      specifically higher in VAT from obese that lean animals, without differences in 
      SAT. It decreased after weight loss induced by energy restriction and correlated 
      with adiposity and inflammatory markers. In humans, the correlation between being 
      obese and higher levels of survivin was confirmed. In obese subjects, survivin 
      levels were reduced following weight loss after either VLCKD or bariatric 
      surgery. Particularly, a decrease in PBMCs expression (not in SAT one) was found 
      after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss is effective in decreasing survivin 
      levels. Also, PBL/PBMC should be regarded as appropriate mirror of survivin 
      levels in VAT for the identification of an obesity-related protumoral 
      microenvironment.

TI  - Pre-bariatric surgery acute kidney injury: Can this be prevented?
PG  - e8070
LID - 10.1002/ccr3.8070 [doi]
LID - e8070
AB  - KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Pre-bariatric surgery dietary recommendations should take 
      into account daily protein intake and other risk factors for kidney injury. This 
      is important because a high protein intake can potentially lead to kidney injury. 
      ABSTRACT: Bariatric surgery has been shown to be a highly effective intervention 
      for achieving weight loss and reducing obesity related-comorbidities. Acute 
      kidney injury (AKI) is considered one of the common complications in 
      perioperative and post-bariatric surgery. However, pre-bariatric surgery AKI has 
      never been reported. Several studies demonstrated that pre-bariatric surgery 
      weight loss improved surgical outcomes and decrease postoperative complications. 
      Some diet regimens have been introduced including low-caloric diet (LCD), 
      very-low caloric diet (VLCD), and very-low caloric ketogenic diet (VLCKD). We 
      present a patient who develops AKI after 10 days of having a high-protein diet 
      from a pre-bariatric weight loss strategy.

TI  - Better Knee, Better Me™: effectiveness of two scalable health care interventions 
      supporting self-management for knee osteoarthritis - protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 160
LID - 10.1186/s12891-020-3166-z [doi]
LID - 160
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although education, exercise, and weight loss are recommended for 
      management of knee osteoarthritis, the additional benefits of incorporating 
      weight loss strategies into exercise interventions have not been well 
      investigated. The aim of this study is to compare, in a private health insurance 
      setting, the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of a remotely-delivered, evidence- 
      and theory-informed, behaviour change intervention targeting exercise and 
      self-management (Exercise intervention), with the same intervention plus active 
      weight management (Exercise plus weight management intervention), and with an 
      information-only control group for people with knee osteoarthritis who are 
      overweight or obese. METHODS: Three-arm, pragmatic parallel-design randomised 
      controlled trial involving 415 people aged ≥45 and ≤ 80 years, with body mass 
      index ≥28 kg/m(2) and < 41 kg/m(2) and painful knee osteoarthritis. Recruitment 
      is Australia-wide amongst Medibank private health insurance members. All three 
      groups receive access to a bespoke website containing information about 
      osteoarthritis and self-management. Participants in the Exercise group also 
      receive six consultations with a physiotherapist via videoconferencing over 6 
      months, including prescription of a strengthening exercise and physical activity 
      program, advice about management, and additional educational resources. The 
      Exercise plus weight management group receive six consultations with a dietitian 
      via videoconferencing over 6 months, which include a very low calorie ketogenic 
      diet with meal replacements and resources to support behaviour change, in 
      addition to the interventions of the Exercise group. Outcomes are measured at 
      baseline, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes are self-reported knee pain and 
      physical function at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include weight, physical 
      activity levels, quality of life, global rating of change, satisfaction with 
      care, knee surgery and/or appointments with an orthopaedic surgeon, and 
      willingness to undergo surgery. Additional measures include adherence, adverse 
      events, self-efficacy, and perceived usefulness of intervention components. 
      Cost-effectiveness of each intervention will also be assessed. DISCUSSION: This 
      pragmatic study will determine whether a scalable remotely-delivered service 
      combining weight management with exercise is more effective than a service with 
      exercise alone, and with both compared to an information-only control group. 
      Findings will inform development and implementation of future remotely-delivered 
      services for people with knee osteoarthritis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New 
      Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12618000930280 (01/06/2018).

TI  - Baseline HOMA IR and Circulating FGF21 Levels Predict NAFLD Improvement in 
      Patients Undergoing a Low Carbohydrate Dietary Intervention for Weight Loss: A 
      Prospective Observational Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu12072141 [doi]
LID - 2141
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of liver 
      disease. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) represent a feasible treatment 
      as they induce profound weight loss and insulin resistance (IR) improvement. 
      Despite the recognized benefits on NAFLD deriving from pharmacological 
      administration of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), whose endogenous 
      counterpart is a marker of liver injury, little is known about its physiology in 
      humans. AIM: To identify predictors of NAFLD improvement as reflected by the 
      reduction of the non-invasive screening tool hepatic steatosis index (HSI) in 
      obese patients undergoing a weight loss program. METHODS: Sixty-five obese 
      patients underwent a 90-day dietary program consisting of a VLCKD followed by a 
      hypocaloric low carbohydrate diet (LCD). Anthropometric parameters, body 
      composition, and blood and urine chemistry were assessed. RESULTS: Unlike most 
      parameters improving mainly during the VLCKD, the deepest HSI change was observed 
      after the LCD (p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Baseline HOMA-IR and serum 
      FGF21 were found to be positive (R = 0.414, p = 0009) and negative (R = 0.364, p 
      = 0.04) independent predictors of HSI reduction, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      suggest that patients with IR and NAFLD derive greater benefit from a VLCKD, and 
      we propose a possible role of human FGF21 in mediating NAFLD amelioration 
      following nutritional manipulation.

TI  - Feasibility of protein-sparing modified fast by tube (ProMoFasT) in obesity 
      treatment: a phase II pilot trial on clinical safety and efficacy (appetite 
      control, body composition, muscular strength, metabolic pattern, pulmonary 
      function test).
PG  - 165-176
AB  - Anecdotal data in the last few years suggest that protein-sparing modified diet 
      (PSMF) delivered by naso-gastric tube enteral (with continuous feeding) could 
      attain an significant weight loss and control of appetite oral feeding, but no 
      phase II studies on safety and efficacy have been done up to now. To verify the 
      safety and efficacy of a protein-sparing modified fast administered by 
      naso-gastric tube (ProMoFasT) for 10 days followed by 20 days of a low-calorie 
      diet, in patients with morbid obesity (appetite control, fat free mass 
      maintenance, pulmonary function tests and metabolic pattern, side effects), 26 
      patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) have been selected. The patients had to follow a 
      protein-sparing fast by enteral nutrition (ProMoFasT) for 24 h/day, for 10 days 
      followed by 20 days of low-calorie diet (LCD). The endpoint was represented by 
      body weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, Haber's appetite test, body 
      composition by body impedance assessment (BIA), handgrip strength test, metabolic 
      pattern, pulmonary function test. Safety was assessed by evaluation of 
      complications and side effects of PSMF and/or enteral nutrition. In this report 
      the results on safety and efficacy are described after 10 and 30 days of 
      treatment. After the recruiting phase, a total of 22 patients out of 26 enrolled 
      [14 (63.6 %) females] were evaluated in this study. Globally almost all clinical 
      parameters changed significantly during first 10 days. Total body weight 
      significantly decreased after 10 days (∆-6.1 ± 2; p < 0.001) and this decrease is 
      maintained in the following 20 days of LCD (∆ = -5.88 ± 1.79; p < 0.001). Also 
      the abdominal circumference significantly decreased after 10 days [median 
      (range): -4.5 (-30 to 0); p < 0.001] maintained then in the following 20 days of 
      LCD [median (range) = -7 (-23.5 to -2); p < 0.001]. All BIA parameters 
      significantly changed after 10 and 30 days from baseline. All parameters except 
      BF had a significant change after 10 days of treatment while the difference at 
      30 days was lower than at 10 days for TBW, FFM and MM with no significant 
      differences from baseline for the last two characteristics. For VAS appetite the 
      difference was significant after 10 days and the decrease in appetite was 
      maintained at 30 days with no significant difference (p = 0.83) between 10 and 
      30 days. No significant differences in the first 30 days were detected for PA and 
      for both left and right hand grip strength. Particularly, a significant reduction 
      of 1.82 kg in FFM after 10 days was detected, but not after 30 days. In contrast, 
      a decrease of 3.8 kg of BF is observed after 30 days. As far as the respiratory 
      functional tests (RFT) are concerned, a significant difference at 10 days was 
      globally observed for functional residual capacity (p = 0.012) and expiratory 
      reserve volume (p = 0.025). There are no reported major complications and side 
      effects resulting from the enteral nutrition or PSMF. In particular, cardiac 
      arrhythmias have not been reported. From the clinical point of view the PSMF with 
      naso-gastric tube (ProMoFasT) method appears safe, it is associated with a 
      significant weight loss related to decrease of FM and not to loss of FFM and 
      appetite decreases. It is relevant that the RFT are significantly improved after 
      only 10 days suggesting the efficacy of this regime in short period, too. These 
      preliminary data underline the necessity to increase the number of RCT for this 
      method, which could represent a possible alternative to other methodologies, such 
      as the intragastric balloon, in particular when it is recommended to improve RFT 
      before bariatric, gynecological, orthopedic and lymphatic surgery.

TI  - The Real-Life Use of a Protein-Sparing Modified Fast Diet by Nasogastric Tube 
      (ProMoFasT) in Adults with Obesity: An Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/nu15224822 [doi]
LID - 4822
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein-sparing modified fast (PSMF) diet is a very-low-carbohydrate 
      ketogenic diet administered to patients with obesity, which preserves lean mass 
      and suppresses appetite as well as continuous enteral feeding. Thus, we aim to 
      evaluate the effect of the PSMF diet administered continuously by nasogastric 
      tube (NGT) or orally. METHODS: Patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 34.9 
      kg/m(2) were randomly assigned to receive a whey protein PSMF formula through NGT 
      (ProMoFasT) or orally. Data were collected at baseline and after 150 days. The 
      endpoints were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: We 
      enrolled 20 patients in the ProMoFasT group and 24 in the oral group. No 
      differences in body weight, BMI or waist circumference between the two groups 
      were found after 150 days. At follow-up, FFM (%) and MM (%) results were higher 
      in the ProMoFasT group than the oral group (63.1% vs. 52.9%, p = 0.012 and 45.0% 
      vs. 36.1%, p = 0.009, respectively) and FM (kg) and FM (%) were significantly 
      lower in the ProMoFasT group (36.9 kg vs. 44.0 kg, p = 0.033 and 37.4% vs. 44.9%, 
      p = 0.012, respectively). Insulin levels were lower in the ProMoFasT group than 
      the oral group at follow-up (11.8 mU/L vs. 28.0 mU/L, p = 0.001, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: The ProMoFasT is more effective in improving body composition and 
      glucometabolic markers than the same diet administered orally.

TI  - Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Staple-Line Oversewing in a Patient with 
      Factor XI Deficiency: A Case Report.
PG  - e942824
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.942824 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery (BS) has a lower percentage of complications than 
      other abdominal surgeries. Hemorrhage in one of the most common complications and 
      can be life-threatening. Hereditary factor XI (FXI) deficiency is a coagulation 
      disorder that can result in excessive bleeding requiring intervention to restore 
      hemostasis. Risks over benefits in patients with morbid obesity with BS 
      indication, as well as those with FXI deficiency, should be carefully evaluated. 
      This article reports the case of an obese woman with FXI deficiency -undergoing 
      SG. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old woman with a BMI of 51 kg/m² was diagnosed as 
      having severe FXI deficiency during preoperative exams prior to bariatric 
      surgery. Virus-inactivated homo-group plasma 10 ml/kg infusion was administrated 
      1 h before surgery, during the entire procedure, and continuing until 
      postoperative day (POD) 4. A very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) was proposed 
      to the patient 4 weeks before surgery. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was 
      performed with staple-line reinforcement by oversewing the seromuscular layer 
      using continuous suture. Subcutaneous enoxaparin 4000 U.I. was administered from 
      POD 1 until POD 25 to prevent any thromboembolic event. The patient was 
      discharged on POD 5 in good clinical condition. CONCLUSIONS Risks of bleeding 
      andor thromboembolic events before or after BS are increased in patient with FXI 
      deficiency. Bariatric surgery in these patients is safe in experienced BS 
      centers, and the risks associated with the obesity seem to exceed those of the 
      coagulopathy and surgery. Careful preoperative counseling, extensive 
      hematological checks, and meticulous surgery are essential to reduce BS risks. 
      Sleeve gastrectomy oversewing the stapler line seems a reasonable choice.
